# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

My aim in Module 1 was to get practice using what I'd managed to teach myself in the months following my college graduation. My interests and passion are heavily in Python and data but I want a foundation in front-end technologies so I can get my foot in the door of a data-related masters program or even a job. My plan was to get this practice through the static comps and pairing projects. What I didn't expect was the differences between Python and JavaScript and the confusion it can cause.

At the beginning of the program I felt prepared, as I'd spent numerous hours watching well-excecuted tutorials and reading the docs. Time constraints became the main problem, as I always desire more thorough learning and experience but still need to complete projects fairly quickly here. Instead of diving deeper into js and jQuery I had to spend time going between flexbox and grid etc. Getting used to CSS required the ironing out of some kinks but the difference betwee what I'm doing now and what I was capable of a year ago is heartening. Despite my increasingly limited free time I completed all projects on time and made it into the later phases in all of them. I look forward to having a week to get the material depth that I didn't have time for during the past few weeks.

In the future I look forward to diving into frameworks and libraries that will make things more interesting, responsive, yet complicated. I will be adjusting my schedule to allow more sleep and take it easier at the gym.

### Number Guesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html
* https://github.com/stone4789/number_guesser
* https://stone4789.github.io/number_guesser/

Construct a game that asks a user to guess a number between 1 and 100. For added difficulty we could add a function to change the number range.

* https://github.com/stone4789/ds-comp-challenge-1
* https://stone4789.github.io/ds-comp-challenge-1/

Static Comps involve being given a design and layout in the form of an image, and recreating it with as much accuracy as possible. With each successive assignment the design is made to be more complicated. We only have creative freedom with color pallettes and content.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
Module1 group projects involved pairing with a new partner to complete increasingly difficult assignments.
Below are all completed group projects:
Linked-List
Idea-Box
2Do-Box


#### Linked-List

* https://github.com/stone4789/ideaBox
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

Build a simple application for recording and archiving ideas, with the ability to give an idea one of five quality ratings and a way to sort the list.

## Student: David & Dave
## Evaluator: Pamela Lovett
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Nice job working through all of the functionality AND completing an extension! Some minor bugs
- Really good execution of the comp!
- Practice reading code aloud

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.


## HTML

## Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

## Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

## Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation


* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
* Exceptional Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.


## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time.
