# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

My aim in Module 1 was to get practice using what I'd managed to teach myself in the months following my college graduation. My interests and passion are heavily in Python and data but I want a foundation in front-end technologies so I can get my foot in the door of a data-related masters program or even a job. My plan was to get this practice through the static comps and pairing projects. What I didn't expect was the differences between Python and JavaScript and the confusion it can cause.

At the beginning of the program I felt prepared, as I'd spent numerous hours watching well-excecuted tutorials and reading the docs. Time constraints became the main problem, as I always desire more thorough learning and experience but still need to complete projects fairly quickly here. Instead of diving deeper into js and jQuery I had to spend time going between flexbox and grid etc. Getting used to CSS required the ironing out of some kinks but the difference betwee what I'm doing now and what I was capable of a year ago is heartening. Despite my increasingly limited free time I completed all projects on time and made it into the later phases in all of them. I look forward to having a week to get the material depth that I didn't have time for during the past few weeks.

In the future I look forward to diving into frameworks and libraries that will make things more interesting, responsive, yet complicated. I will be adjusting my schedule to allow more sleep and take it easier at the gym.
