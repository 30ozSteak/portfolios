## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
This module I set out to, generally, be ok with letting go of control while trying to progress forward.  I think the projects in module 1 are characterized by intensive logic and algorithmic thinking, which requires knowing evey step of the process.  This is in stark contrast to adjusting to a web framework where there are a lot of moving pieces and knowing the exact details of every piece is not necessarily important / efficient.  I feel successful in this regard, in that I feel comfortable in rails and am comfortable not knowing every single detail.  I feel like I have the resources in place to research issues as they come up and have become more familiar with the documentation.  Being comfortable being uncomfortable has also applied to adjusting to front-end, which was another goal of mine.  Although I definitely feel more comfortable with html/css, I know there is a lot of room for improvement.  Although I feel somewhat successful in this regard, I would still like to observe a css wiz in action (using developer tools/ though process) and try to adopt some of their approaches.  Lastly, I initially set out to become more familiar with SQL and database relations.  I started strong with this, spending a lot of time on prework in regards to SQL, and think this has waned a bit over the module.  I would like to continue practicing SQL to feel comfortable with intermediate to advanced queries.  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I think I can speak to when I struggled most in this module, which was early on, first 1/3 or so.  There are a lot of new things thrown at you early, not necessarily new concepts but new tools - and I found it diffcult to prioritize these.  I think this is very much the nature of Turing in general, but I can say it felt more stressful to me than most of mod 1.  From this I think I learned to rely on fellow students more as people will probably have spent more time with one tool or another.  I think in general this was true for most of the students in the module, as I worked and brainstormed with a more diverse range of students than previously.  I think I also struggled a lot with code-alongs early in the module.  I had a tendency to just rote-type, having to worry about not falling behind rather than absorbing the process and principles being laid out.  About week 3 or 4 I changed my method, and rather than just looking over the lesson plans I would spend 40 minutes before class coding them out.  This allowed me to reinforce the code-along of the day and spend more cognitive resources to focus on the process itself.     

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I really enjoyed the rails mini project this module, it was the first project opportunity we have had to pursue a personal intersest of ours.  I enjoyed having to come up with something and fit it within the criteria listed in the project.  I hope to continue to build on my personal project going forward.  I also enjoyed dividing responsibility and learning about git workflow styles during bike share.  That said I think bikeshare was the most stressful early on, there were a lot of different tasks to tackle, and seeding issues prevented experimenting in rails console.  After we got through this we were able to divide and conquer and be much more efficient.  I think job tracker was probably my least favorite project.  As a practical application I didn't find the premise that believable.  I also was not excited about the self assessment aspect, which I think the large majority of students do anyway as they proceed through various iterations of a project.  That said I found it very helpful (the project) in becoming more comfortable with rails.
