# M3 Portfolio Requirements

## Learning Goals

* Gain comfort speaking about and defending their work and code using correct technical vocabulary
* Practice speaking in front of a group
* Build the skill of storytelling by presenting a compelling story about themselves and their work

## Requirements

* Students will prepare a 5 minute slide presentation to give to M3 Instructors.

#### The slide presentation should address the following questions:

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
* How did your Mod 3 experience impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

#### The presentation should not be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).

## Submittal

* Students are not required to submit any documents but instead should be prepared to give their presentation to their instructors and answer follow up questions
