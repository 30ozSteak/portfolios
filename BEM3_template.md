## Areas of Emphasis

> This module I wanted to push myself to start learning Javascript, and get some experience with remote pairing. I also wanted to get much more comfortable consuming APIs.

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/API-Curious)**
>* API-Curious was a project experimenting with Reddit's API.
The goal was to authenticate a user via OAuth, then access that user's Reddit information including subreddits subscribed to, username, and karma score.
>* This project was an ambitious undertaking. I quickly realized I was the only one tackling the Reddit API, and while I could have changed to Github I wanted to struggle through it to see what I would learn. I ultimately was able to hand-roll my Oauth to Reddit, then I refactored using the OmniAuth gem. I wasn't able to finish what I wanted in terms of the cloning part of the project, but I would love to go back to polish it off.
