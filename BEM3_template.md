Lead and organized Posse (Vaughan) among other activities (see below).

#### **Posse**
  * Knowledge share between FE and BE. General support group. Lots of show and tell.
  * Seeing everyone's work progress was incredible. Also learning from other students.
  * On a personal note, the leadership and organization is always valuable. Next time, I'd like to take more advantage of mentors.
