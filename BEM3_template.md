# JF Lalonde - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module I wanted to push myself to start learning Javascript, and get some experience with remote pairing. I also wanted to get much more comfortable consuming APIs.

>* Overall this mod was exhausting, and it was amazing. I finally felt like I had enough base knowledge to go out and try new things, and while it was a constant struggle I feel like the projects I have to show for it are things I am proud of. I would love to go back and refactor them over break.
>* I want to host Palpit8 on AWS and write better docs for it. I also feel so much more comfortable with JS, JQuery, and AJAX.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[API-Curious](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/API-Curious)**
>* API-Curious was a project experimenting with Reddit's API.
The goal was to authenticate a user via OAuth, then access that user's Reddit information including subreddits subscribed to, username, and karma score.
>* This project was an ambitious undertaking. I quickly realized I was the only one tackling the Reddit API, and while I could have changed to Github I wanted to struggle through it to see what I would learn. I ultimately was able to hand-roll my Oauth to Reddit, then I refactored using the OmniAuth gem. I wasn't able to finish what I wanted in terms of the cloning part of the project, but I would love to go back to polish it off.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/rales-engine)** 
>* Rales Engine was a revisiting of the business intelligence and relationships found in the Black Thursday project. This time around, CSVs were used to populate a database, and the analytics were performed using SQL/ActiveRecord.
>* My main takeaways here were that I finally got an opportunity to pair remotely, which had been a goal for some time. I also gained more comfort using ActiveRecord, but it also showed me how much more I need to push to get to where I want to be. Using serializers for the first time was fairly straightforward and overally pretty enjoyable.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/bretfunk/palpit8)** 
>* Palpit8 is a clone of Twitch.tv that analyzes chatroom data of gamer streams through the Watson Tone Analyzer and returns real-time visualization of the mood of a chatroom.
>* This was my favorite project so far at Turing, and one I want to polish a bit more because I will be showcasing it to potential employers. Making API calls to Watson was fairly straightforward, but getting all the parts to fit together was a huge challenge: Taking chat log data and clearing it after consuming it, then presenting the output through ActionCable. This is where I began to really see that I could take on things that were completely new to me and figure them out.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/cloney_island_airbnb)** 
>* Sprint 2 of an Airbnb Clone where we were expected to fix bugs and polish off a brownfield project to get it presentable in production.
>* This was my first brownfield project, and it was pretty overwhelming to step into someone else's code initially. After taking the time to figure out what was going on, we managed to fix all the bugs and polish off all the features that we wanted to in development, but we had one hiccup in production with the two-factor authentication. I really enjoyed getting the Mapbox API to work in conjuction with the Airbnb API, and was able to have a map generate pins of the properties we returned from Airbnb after filtering for location. This made me more comfortable with AJAX as well as JS/JQuery.
