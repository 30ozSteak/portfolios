### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rufusasterisk/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Description
Build HTML and CSS to match the given composition image. Create a number guessing game that allows the user to set the range and provides feedback if the number is too large or too small.

#### Evaluation Comments
Great job!
Pixel perfect match of the comp (WAHOO!)
Love the initialize/start page, it needs a little polish to make it really clear for users -- get it in front of a few people and let their feedback guide your adjustments.
Total ownership of the codebase, was able to answer and explain all questions and suggestions made, all choices in the code were carefully considered and implemented.
extremely thoughtful about execution and craft of the code
work on including ARIA/accessibility in HTML!

### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rufusasterisk/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

#### Description
Not an object based list, but a web app that stores links in a list. The list allows cards to be added, flagged as read, and removed. We added counters and mass delete functions.

#### Evaluation Comments
Awesome, awesome work. Really great workflow. A few small tweaks on the comp matching and there are places you can easily refactor some JS. Only refactoring recommended is around breaking out functions not actually the code itself.

#### Evaluation Scores

#### Feedback to Me

I really enjoyed this project, and it felt like a great even-share partnership. Your skillset for project management and git workflow was a huge part of our success, and I truly learned a lot from you. In future pair projects, I would continue to leverage these skills while being mindful of what level of comfort your partner might have using kanban/github/project workflow.

#### Feedback to Me

Hey Rufus loved being your partner I learned a lot from you on idea box. I feel like you helped to solidify my knowledge of git hub and helped me to be less cloudy on javascript. I guess one thing that you could work on is your availability I feel like we could have worked a bit more on idea box and got the css really dialed in. Other wise you're a really awesome teacher and really have a firm grasp on the material. Working with you is always a great experience 10/10 would work again.
