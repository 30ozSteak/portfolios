Adam - Adam was really fun to work with! He really pushed me to try new things that I was hesitant to try at first, such as Vue.js - and I’m really glad we went that route. As always he’s a champ at design and css. He could have maybe gotten his hands on the Vue more, but this was probably more my fault for not explaining things very well than his - sorry about that, Adam! Ultimately, I was really happy that he pushed me on this one, and very happy with how it turned out.
