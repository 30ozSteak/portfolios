## A: End of Module Assessment Status

(Please Indicate if Pass/Fail/Pending)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individually, I feel that my progress over the course of the MOD as increased greatly, and it is much easier for me to write code when I am not in an evaluation.  However, I do not feel that I am ready for promotion to MOD 2.  I feel it is in my best interest to have a better understanding of the fundementals before advancement.

## C: Group Work & Projects

I felt that I was very lucky in that I was matched with three great pairing partners.  I find I am able to work well when I am able to bounce ideas off of someone else, and I am generally able to add value to the team.  While I do find it very hard to write JS or JQ when staring at a blank screen, it is much easier with another set of eyes.  I feel that I worked well with all of my partners and was able to contribute to each pairing.
