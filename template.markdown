-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

## [https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1611/mod-1/oop-assessment/krystin.md]Object (Oriented Programming Assessment) 
## Evaluator: Louisa

## Notes:
Good job! A little softer on the JS foundations than I expected, understands syntax but needs to be sure to review/solidify the basics moving forward.

## Rubric

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Problem Solving

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity, and can effectively leverage documentation

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## DOM Assessment
## Evaluator: Robbie

## Notes:

* A little hesitant on JS and jQuery mixing (doing math with JS and not using jQuery...), but overall good.
* Jumping far ahead in terms of functionality - want to see a more granular breakdown of the problem, testing assumptions along the way (using `console.log`).

## Rubric

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser
### Evaluator: Louisa

* [Number Guesser](https://github.com/krystin987/numberguesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phases 1-3 = MASTER branch for evaluation.
If you elect Phase 4, create a separate branch for that work.

### UX/UI Expectations

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

### Fundamental HTML

- 2:  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Linked List

* [Linked-List](https://github.com/juliankyer/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

### Evaluator: Louisa

### Notes:
very nicely done, NO GLOBAL VARIABLES! JS very concise, small focused functions. well done. main docking of points was from small details around syntax that will become non-issues with experience. Nicely balanced JS and CSS writing between the pair.

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.


#### Idea Box

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes:

  * Filter was not working, but implementation was close (jQuery each)
  * Good conversation in GitHub, but more of it, especially in the PR descriptions
  * Good JS - continue refactoring and breaking out logic into smaller, more readable functions

### Specification Adherence

* 2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 2:  Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Collaboration

* 3 - Team members employ PRs and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

## Rebecca Holt - Game Time Project Parter

Positive feedback about our pairing:
You are tenacious and willing to try things that might be scary - like making Tetris! (RIP Tetris). When you set out to tackle a given feature, you make it work, and you celebrate the small victories that lead to the whole. This is a successful strategy in any project!

Constructive criticism about our pairing
Try to trust you teammates a little more on things that seem abstract at first. It's OK to read the code around you, especially our peers.

Additional comments:
As a team, I think we'll finish this game project pretty strong. When we ran into tension and discourse, we both illustrated our perspectives, read through the code together, made some fast compromises and kept moving forward. The tensions will happen, we handled it really well.

## Julian Kyer - Linked List Project Partner



### Being a Community Member

## Rebecca Holt - Game Time Project Partner
Positive:

You are hard working and have drive that is contagious. Your determination is inspiring. You're great at utilizing the resources you have around you -- keep that up!

Needs Improvement:

Sometimes you can be a hard ball which is great when working on projects but can also be somewhat hindering for group work.

## Julian Kyer - Linked List Project Partner

Positive: 

You aren't afraid to try a bunch of things out and see what happens. You move a team along and keep things fresh with new ideas.

Needs Improvement:

Be mindful of the fact that you might work quickly for some. Not necessarily a bad thing, but your pace can be really fast.

### Playing a Part

I participated in the hackathon during the second week at Turing.

I participated in teaching elementary school kids in Arvada about Arduinos having no prior experience.
