# Dylan Avery - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For M1, my main goal was to strengthen my understanding of how CSS, HTML, and JavaScript work together, and how to build applications by combining all three together. I also was really focused on becoming a good team member, a good pair, and an active member of the community. A third goal of mine for this Mod was to drastically improve my LinkedIn profile and my Resume, and to think about "my story" and how to start telling it better. Also, within a week of starting M1 I
realized that I had to really start thinking more like a "designer" too, and so
I've been trying to get better at paying attention to color, type, and examples of good design and good UX in my everyday life experience.

Feedback from Sam Johnson:

'Hey Dylan, I really enjoyed working with you - I consider you to be one of the better developers in our cohort and it was nice to have the chance to partner.  I was impressed by your positive attitude and desire to dig in and get shit done.  I also think we did a great job of splitting off and getting big chunks of the work done efficiently and effectively and was pumped it all came together so seamlessly.  I felt like we worked well as a team and it was fun to dig into our final technical challenges together and celebrate the win when we figured it out!  I would partner with you again in a second.  

Some constructive feedback I have for you is to make sure you are taking sometime after finishing up some work/coding (or throughout) to check for mistakes and/or ensure things look clean.  I noticed a few instances where your code wasn’t lined up correctly and some places where the CSS could have been a bit more lined up with the comps. Nothing major at all but think a bit more attention to detail could really push you forward as a really solid dude in our cohort.

Cheers! -Sam'

Feedback from Mike Limberg:

Overall awesome working with you! Appreciated the hard work to get things working and your willingness to stay late and get things done with a tight timeline. Your javascript abilities helped get us going out of the gates when I had little idea on where to start.

constructive criticism I have would be to work on how you explain things to others. Maybe explain it to the rubber duck to practice? A lot of stuff you did made clear sense to you but was harder for me to understand, and being able to clearly explain it all to your partner(s) will only help you learn faster.

Also try to stay on track with the group goal when you’re tempted to go down a rabbit hole on something you just want to figure out at that moment. I’m 100% guilty of this all the time and there were times when both of us wanted to deviate a certain way, so figured I’d call it out.

Again awesome job man! Excited to see the refactor and hope to work with you again on projects in future mods.

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown](Vote Your Conscience)

  Our discussion was refreshingly full of disagreement. Our first speaker stressed the importance of voting, our second speaker however felt the opposite way, and voiced his apathy with voting. Our third and fourth speakers spoke about using a guide to decide how to vote, which I thought also had a lot of merit. What I took away from all this is that "whether or not voting matters" is something dualistic, that effects everybody these days. They want to believe in voting, but sometimes its hard.We ran out of time before I got a chance to talk, but I basically just wanted to tell everyone how much I enjoyed their input, and that in the future I might start using a guide to vote like we had discussed.  I for one, am a big fan of Barack Obama, as a statesman and an orator, and I was also going to talk about how I think he brings a level of intellectualism to the White House that is missing, traditionally.

  * [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown](Introversion)

    This was an almost eerily serendipitous discussion to walk into on Friday afternoon. At lunch, my group had started talking about a guy who had left Turing because he had trouble with all the community and social stuff. He was not really a people person they said, and then they started  to talk about whether or not Turing is too hard on introverts. I for one, said that the "culture" of Turing is well spelled out for us, and that I specifically wanted to come to Turing because of the social aspect, the focus on teamwork, and the community element. Then, after the TED talk video finished, I liked at our rubric and was kind of awe struck that the questions were basically dealing with this exact discussion we had. In a way, during our Gear Up discussion, I felt a little abrasive, as I defended extroversion as a principle, and lashed out somewhat against introversion. But for me, being introverted is something that has caused me a lot of trouble in the past. So when I seek out experiences like team building or joining a community, its kind of my way of "overcoming introversion". For me, everything is about balance, the "yin and the yang". So I know that I like to work at home sometimes, and even need to sometimes. But I don't want to use that as an excuse to lower my attendance and participation, and what I said in our discussion is that I hope Turing sticks with their culture, and continues to encourage social interaction

To Jeff Buss:

'Hey Jeff, working with you was very good. It really couldn’t have gone more easily. It was definitely helpful to have someone whose brain was firing off when mine was not. The late night work session would have been a lot more painful without you to help me get over the walls that I would hit. You definitely have a gift for algorithmic thinking and tackling problems, and you aren’t happy until you have solved them. I was really impressed with how quickly you took to CSS, Im sure it would have been impossible for me to figure most of that stuff out on my own. You also did a great job of focusing on your own feature whilst letting me focus on mine.

Some constructive criticism I would have is to make sure to overly communicate if anything, so that there isn’t any confusion amongst partners. This was obviously especially important for us since we were not really using gitHub properly that first week. Also make sure to always run a bunch of tests on the final product before Evals to make sure that no weird bugs pop up at the last second.'

To Mike Limberg:

'Hey Mike, working with you was definitely a pleasure. It really couldn’t have gone more easily. It was definitely helpful to have someone whose brain was firing off when mine was not. The late night work session would have been a lot more painful without you to help me get over the walls that I would hit. You definitely have a gift for algorithmic thinking and tackling problems, and you aren’t happy until you have solved them.

Some constructive criticism would be for us to have better gitHub convos and to do pull requests properly. Im pretty sure we have both made leaps and bounds in this area since then.'

To Sam Johnson:

'Hey Sam, working with you was a great experience, and I probably experienced the most growth pairing with you! I was really impressed with your ability to figure things out with no delay. I was also really impressed with how well our project came together, we did a good job of splitting up the work and merging it all to one final project, and your ability to write code collaboratively made all the difference. It was also fun to share your passion for problem solving, and celebrate with you when we overcame an obstacle. You also did a great job of walking me through some of the localStorage stuff you did that I hadn’t quite grasped.


Some constructive criticism I would have is to try and be as inclusive as possible when choosing a specific route to go down. I think that if you know you are right it might be more difficult for you to explain Why you are right, instead of just saying “trust me.” At the end of the day though if I got frustrated it was also great for me to check my emotions as far as letting go of control and redoing work.'

### Playing a Part

At the start of Mod1 I joined the Verou posse and attended most of their spike sessions and lunches. I engaged in discussion about typography, and other subjects covered in Verou. I also participated in the SVG tutorial that Chelsea and Lacey provided, which was very helpful and useful.

I've also attended all of the Improv sessions with Chris and Jessica (although Jessica hasn't actually been there this Mod).

On Thursdays i've attended 1 of 3 meditation sessions offered by Adam, and hope to make time on Thursday mornings to attend them regularly as well.

While at Turing so far i've made it a point to attend all of the Friday morning guest talks. I've also paired with a couple students to help them compose music using the Ableton software, and have reached out over Slack to offer this to fellow students.

On Fridays, i've been an active and engaging participant in all of the lunch roulette sessions. I also enjoyed these very much, as it was the best opprutunity to meet people outside of my Module, and to explore the 16th st. area with them allowed me to discover some new things about he neighborhood.

Also, I started a slack channel for students who want to go to Nuggets games.
