## A: End of Module Assessment

I am cautiously optimistic.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual project for M1 was Number Guesser.

#### Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

**Overview**
* Number Guesser was my first effort at writing an application using Javascript.  I was very pleased with my effort on this project and felt it was a pretty decent first attempt.  My biggest struggle here was that my approach was way too dependant on global varialbes.  As a result, it was very difficult to use named functions outside of the event listeners.  This struggle would continue into the first group project as well.

**Feedback**
* My feedback from Pam was mostly positive, but she encouraged me to keep practicing CSS in order do a better job of fine-tuning some the visual details of the assignment.  She pointed out some instances where elements were not aligning properly and said I could improve the organization of my CSS.  There were also opportunities to improve the usability of the UI/US.
