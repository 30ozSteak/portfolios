**Action Step #1:** 
-Done

**Action Step #2:** Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?
-I would like to have a job by March 15th.  I feel that this is reasonable and attainable if I commit to the schedule and daily activities.  I have scheduled daily time from 1-2:45pm to spend on resumes and cover letters and 3-4pm for active outreach. 

**Action Step #3:** Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals to reach in order to reach your big goal:
-I plan to submit 4 applications per week which would be almost 1 per weekday. Over the course of 9 weeks, that would mean 36 submitted applications.  If I use the 1 interview for 7 resumes submitted average, this would equate to 5 interviews and hopefully at least 2 - 3 offers.  


### Coding
For time spent coding during your first 30 days post-grad, consider:
* What skills would you like to improve or develop?
-I really need to spend more time on the coding interview questions and technical challenges. 
* Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up?
-I think I just need more practice with technical interview questions overall.  I would like to start doing problems in LeetCode and more exercism challenges.   
* Are there new languages or technologies you'd like to learn? How and when will you do that?
-I am curious about Angular, React Native, and PWAs.  I would like to work on a personal project in at least one of these but would like to do more research before I select one to start.

**Action Step:** Establish a “daily-practice” repository where you’ll put small daily exercises or work on issues from your own projects that you want to update to keep your skills sharp and your GitHub activity chart active. For your Mod 4 portfolio review, be prepared to describe to your instructors what you plan to work on to sharpen and advance your coding skills for the first 30 days of your job search.

### Outreach & Networking
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking to stay on track during your first 30 days.

**Action Step #1:** Identify at least 3 individuals from companies you're tracking who could connect with during your first 30 days. Describe why you want to connect with these people and what you hope to talk about, when you will email them by, and what your follow-up will look like once you've met with them.
I have already met with 8 people for coffee meetings.  I need to reschedule a meeting with Melissa Tondi with Rainforest QA.  I would like to 

**Action Step #2:** Find 3 new meetups or other career networking events to join during your first 30 days post-grad and describe why you'll attend those particular events. How will attending these meetups benefit you in your job search? How can you contribute to the community of these meetups? If you're interested in speaking at any of these meetups, describe how you'll connect with the organizers to arrange that and give a brief (2-3 sentences) pitch on what you might talk about and why.
-Code for Denver on Mondays at 6pm
I am interested in civic tech and have been wanting to attend this meetup for awhile.  I would like to network with others who are currently working in civic tech.  
-Women Who Code on 2nd Thursday of month at 5:30pm
I am interested in this group to stay connected to other women in tech.  I think it will be important to surround myself with other women as I continue in this career. I also think it will be a good networking opportunity to find companies that have a good work culture for women. I 
-Tech Confluence on 3rd Wednesday of month at Noon
I like that this group meets up over lunch and has 3 speakers each session.  I don't know a lot about it but I am curious to check it out.

### Job/Company Research & Tracking
Success in the job search means staying organized. The best way to do that is to have a clear system to keep track of your contacts, research, and updates on what you're doing.

**Action Step:** Show how you've set up a tracker such as Trello, spreadsheet, [jobtrack.io](https://jobtrack.io), or [huntr.co](https://huntr.co) to keep track of all your company/job outreach, who you talked to, what you learned, what next steps you'll take to follow-up, and anything you might do differently next time. Be prepared to describe this system to your instructors during your portfolio review.
I have a Trello board set up to track categories Interested, Cold Outreach, Applied, Interviews, and Offers.

### Interview Prep
During this module, you've had multiple opportunities to practice your technical and cultural interviewing skills. Think about how those experiences have helped you identify strengths and weaknesses in your interviewing skills.

**Action Step:** Identify 2-3 areas you'd like to continue to improve on for interviewing and outline concrete action steps on how you will improve those skills. If you plan on setting up more mock interviews, identify who you will set those up with and by what date.
I think the biggest opportunity of growth for me is the technical challenges.  I think it would be beneficial to set up a mock interview to 


### Housekeeping
Make sure you have all your job search components up-to-date and looking their best!

**Action Step #1:** Ensure your [Turing Portfolio](https://alumni.turing.io) has **at least 3 projects displayed,** including your latest work, and an accurate list of your desired locations. Be prepared to show this to your instructors during your M4 portfolio review.
This is complete
**Action Step #2:** Ensure your LinkedIn is up to date and indicates that you’re job hunting. Indicate here a summary of any adjustments you made and how you'll continue to update it and/or use the site to build your network and online presence.
This is complete
### Other
What other areas would you like to focus on during your job search? Some possible ideas include:
* Social Networking
* Blogging
* Planning and submitting meetup and/or conference talks
* Participating in hackathons or open source projects

**Action Step:** Identify one of the areas above or an additional area that you'd like to develop further during your first 30 days post-grad and be prepared to discuss this with your instructors at your portfolio review.
Participating in open source projects - I know this is a huge focus of Code for Denver and I'd like to attend their next meetup so I can start contributing to an open source project.

### Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?
Accountability is key during a job search and being able to check in with a person whom you trust (or, ideally, more than one person) on your progress will increase your ability to reach your goals in the timeline you've created.

**Action Step:** Identify 1-2 people you'll check in with during your first 30 days post-grad. Consider how you might continue to utilize your PD Peer Groups. Describe why you will check in with this person, how you will check in with them, what you aim to talk about, and what you hope to get out of these check-ins to benefit your job search.
I will check in with my job group and will also plan to attend Kayt's weekly sessions.  I am not concerned about accountability as I am self motivated and will complete the necessary tasks to secure a job.

### Identifying & Overcoming Barriers
While you've made concrete plans for how to achieve your goal, it's also important to take stock of what could hold you back in the job search.

**Action Step:** Identify 1-2 "barriers" you might put on yourself in this job search as well as the steps you will take to overcome them. Be prepared to describe these in your M4 portfolio review.
I am pretty motivated to get a job so I am not really sure how to answer this.  The only barrier I forsee is not applying to something because I feel that I don't meet the qualifications.  I will make a conscious effort to not discount myself from an opportunity based on this.
