# (Cierra Washington) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to build a strong foundation in JavaScript/jQuery and CSS. My ultimate goal is to be great at both of these languages. I do believe that I my goal of getting a strong foundation.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.2/4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5/4
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5/4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5/4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3/4

------------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I think that I passed the end of module assessment. I think I did well on the challenges of the week (DOM manipulation and mythical creatures), as well as the personal and group projects. I also have a solid understanding of CSS grid, and how to structure a layout overall. Additionally, I have a good grasp of the foundational JavaScript and jQuery topics that we went over in this mod. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I learned a lot while working on these individual and group projects. I was able to learn more about myself particularly through the group projects. I think that overall I did well on both the individual and group projects.

# Number Guesser

* [Number Guesser](https://github.com/cierrajw/NumberGuesser)
* [Number Guesser Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

(description):

Number guesser was the initial project at Turing that helped get me off the ground in terms of confidence with JavaScript. This project gave me the confidence to attempt to conquer the other projects, and each subsequent project did the same.

## Evaluation comments

### Evaluator: Louisa
### Notes/What To Work On:

- got through phase 3!!
- very minimal styling, not fonts
- watch indentation, especially with JS
- in a good spot for refactoring
- watch out for long functions


## Functional Expectations

* Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.  

(evaluation scores): 3-4

# Static Comp 1

* [Static Comp 1](https://github.com/cierrajw/cjw-comp-challenge-1)
* [Static Comp 1 Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

(description):

Static comp 1 was my very first static comp challenge, where I was really able to utilize grid and flex box and start to understand how they work. 

(evaluation comments):

Great feedback, just could space the arrows on my side image better, and fix the < 320 media query alignment.

# Static Comp 2

* [Static Comp 2](https://github.com/cierrajw/cjw-comp-challenge-2)
* [Static Comp 2 Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

(description):

Static comp 2 was an exploration in more advanced grid topics such as auto fit and minmax. 

(evaluation comments):

I did a great job with aligning things on the page as well as media queries, just could work on fonts to really make the page "pop"

# Static Comp 3

* [Static Comp 3](https://github.com/cierrajw/cw-comp-challenge-3)
* [Static Comp 3 Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

(description):

Static comp 3 was definitely a learning experience for me, and a challenge (mostly in patience, and media queries). I think I did a great job overall mimicking the original comp, particularly in desktop mode. I also explored other things like creating a bargraph with Canvas and also a jQuery toggle for the side menu. I feel that I have a great idea of how to structure a page by looking at it and planning it out, using CSS grid. 


(evaluation comments):

I did a great job with structuring the page and my code, and I could do better with media queries as far as a liquid layout with the complex comp. I just have to watch a video or two, becuase I understand grid and flex pretty well, but the media queries got a little "squirely". 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

# Linked List

[Linked List](https://github.com/cierrajw/linked-list)
* [Linked List Assignmentt](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

(description):

Linked list is a project that allowed me to understand the concept of appending/prepending elements to other elements on a page. 

Evaluation Comments:

## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice detailed commit messages
* Make more commit messages and use more branches everytime you add a new feature 
* Good UI in general, careful of spacing between title and image
* Careful of adding too many scrolls especially for mobile
* Great structure of html and use of aria-labels
* Good use of grouping 
* Good organization of classes
* Experiment using pixels/percentages for height/width and margin/padding
* Good organization of global variables
* Good consistency of separating event listeners and functions
* Careful of creating a huge function and having event listeners/function declarations inside of it
* Good use of broken out functions later with single use responsibilities

## Functional Expectations

* Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

(evaluation scores): 3-4

(feedback to me): Good job understanding the JS, and good job with aria labels. Could make more git commits. 

# Idea Box

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/cierrajw/idea-box)
* [Idea Box Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

(description):

Idea box was a next level exploration of JavaScript (particularly in terms of learning things like local storage), and I was able to really use and start to understand jQuery. 

Evaluation comments:

## Evaluator: David Whitaker
## Notes/What To Work On:

### HTML
* use aria labels on inputs

### CSS
* consider moving element selectors to the top
* Love those organizational comments
* consider using classes more

### JS
* Great style and naming conventions
* Use constructor functions!
* Separate the data model from the markup - the way things are displayed will always change
* Think about having a qualities array

### Git
* Nice work!

## Functional Expectations

Proficient/The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

(evaluation scores): 3-4

# 2DoBox-Pivot

* [2DoBox-Pivot](https://github.com/cierrajw/2DoBox--Pivot)
* [2DoBox-Pivot](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

(description):

The 2DoBox-Pivot was a project that allowed me to really solidify some concepts such as local storage and JSON, as well as grasp jQuery even better. I was able to help my partner understand some concepts, and I was able to see him become a more confident programmer, especially with the help of his mentor. 

(evaluation comments):

## Students: Alex and Cierra
## Evaluator: Louisa
## Notes/What To Work On:

- nice disabled save button color choices/behavior
- good "completed" button addition
- nice use of transitions when filtering cards
- good github workflow, make sure you're writing clear commit messages, some were a little unclear
- nice use of ARIA
- missing closing HTML tag
- still some unused/unneeded CSS, still could use a clean up refactor pass
- JS is tidy and well factored
- Fantastic use of terminology and really, really good at speaking about your code and the decisions that went into it
- really good team work! So awesome to see a team that worked so well together and enjoyed working together.
- REALLY GOOD JOB!!!!!

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  

(evaluation scores): 3-4

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community):

I think that I supported the larger Turing community in a couple of ways. One way is that I was able to help my fellow classmates who were in need of a push in terms of understanding their projects, or in terms of motivation. Another way is that I made sure to do my part as far as cleaning/maintaining our classroom space, and cleaning up after myself in the kitchen.
