## A: End of Module Assessment

I think that I passed the end of module assessment. I think I did well on the personal projects, as well as the group projects. My media queries on a very complex layout (such as static comp 3) could use some tweaking, but I have a solid understanding of CSS grid, and how to structure a layout overall. I also have a good grasp of the foundational JavaScript and jQuery topics that we went over in this mod.
