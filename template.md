# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to build a strong foundation in JavaScript/jQuery and CSS. My goal is to be great at both of these languages. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5/4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.6/4
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.6/4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5/4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3/4

------------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I think that I passed the end of module assessment. I think I did well on the challenges of the week (DOM manipulation and mythical creatures), as well as the personal and group projects. I also have a solid understanding of CSS grid, and how to structure a layout overall. Additionally, I have a good grasp of the foundational JavaScript and jQuery topics that we went over in this mod. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I learned a lot while working on these individual and group projects. I was able to learn more about myself particularly through the group projects. I think that overall I did well on both the individual and group projects.

Number guesser was the initial project at Turing that helped get me off the ground in terms of confidence with JavaScript. This project gave me the confidence to attempt to conquer the other projects, and each subsequent project did the same.
