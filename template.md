# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to build a strong foundation in JavaScript/jQuery and CSS. My goal is to be great at both of these languages. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5/4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.6/4
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.6/4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3.5/4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3/4

------------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I think that I passed the end of module assessment. I think I did well on the challenges of the week (DOM manipulation and mythical creatures), as well as the personal and group projects. I also have a solid understanding of CSS grid, and how to structure a layout overall. Additionally, I have a good grasp of the foundational JavaScript and jQuery topics that we went over in this mod. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I learned a lot while working on these individual and group projects. I was able to learn more about myself particularly through the group projects. I think that overall I did well on both the individual and group projects.

Number guesser was the initial project at Turing that helped get me off the ground in terms of confidence with JavaScript. This project gave me the confidence to attempt to conquer the other projects, and each subsequent project did the same.

(Intro)

# Linked List

[Linked List](https://github.com/cierrajw/linked-list)

* Good organization of classes
* Experiment using pixels/percentages for height/width and margin/padding
* Good organization of global variables
* Good consistency of separating event listeners and functions

### HTML
* use aria labels on inputs

### CSS

* Great style and naming conventions
* Use constructor functions!
* Separate the data model from the markup - the way things are displayed will always change
* Think about having a qualities array

### Git
* Nice work!

## Functional Expectations

Proficient/The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

I think that I supported the larger Turing community in a couple of ways. One way is that I was able to help my fellow classmates who were in need of a push in terms of understanding their projects, or in terms of motivation. Another way is that I made sure to do my part as far as cleaning/maintaining our classroom space, and cleaning up after myself in the kitchen.
