##### Feedback
“Appreciations
++ Exemplary Patience in allowing me time to grasp new concepts prior to implementation.
++ Taking the time to also teach/coach new concepts for possible Phase 3/4 implementations, which was GREATLY appreciated.
++ Specificity
++ Prompt and Reliable
++ Intentionally kind and clear communication
++ Desire to maintain preset DTR goals and actions
++ Relatively easy flow of unified goal setting and daily planning.
++ Worked well around varying schedules.

Coaching
++ Doing pairings on parts of the project outside of our agreed upon time to work together on the project.
++ A bit more  focus on specific tasks in future pairs.  There were times when focus would completely jump around and shift from the task at hand.
++ Consistent utilization of stress management exercises from the Gear-Ups/Professional Development courses. ”


#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hannahbare/idea-box-1801)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### Description
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).
Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

##### Evaluation comments & scores

+ General
- Search functionality incomplete
- Can not edit the content of the cards

+ Design/comp recreation
- Deign/comp recreation hold up well with responsiveness

+ Git/GitHub
- Good number of commits (51)
- Continue to push forward with concise, clear descriptions for commit messages

+ HTML
- Good organization
- Nice job using `aria-label` on inputs. Be sure to put a form around your search input
- Accesibility pretty good on screenreader

+ CSS
- Built design mobile first!
- Nice job using two media queries for responsiveness
- Err on the side of avoiding IDs for styling in CSS due to their high specificity and problems that can be created with this in larger codebases 
- Declarations should be organized alphabetically or idiomatically

+ JS

- Unclear why param of `quality` is defined in 13
- Good jon with SRP on functions. Clean code that is pretty easy to follow
- Some opportunities for refactoring
- `else if` not necessary in 66 and 80. Could just be `else`

+ Pairing

- Opportunities for both to be pushed out of comfort zone and collaborate in ways that are not comfortable

+ Functional Expectations

* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.
* Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

+ HTML

+ Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
* Exceptional Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.

+ Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

+ CSS

+ Structure of Code

* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

+ Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.


+ JAVASCRIPT

+ Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

+ Conditional Logic

* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

+ Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

+ Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

+ Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.
* Exceptional Can identify and apply best use cases for constructor functions vs object 

+ DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

+ Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

+ GIT & GITHUB

+ Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

+ GitHub

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.


+ DESIGN

+ Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

+ PAIRING

+ Collaboration

* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.

##### Feedback
+ It was a good learning experience pairing with Hannah. We have very different learning styles and we worked at accommodating both styles. I very much appreciated her patience and admire her communication skills. Hannah is very hard on herself and I would just suggest that she show herself the same amount of patience she generously affords others.

## D: Professional Skills
In Module One, career development is focused on strategies to help students be successful at Turing. The following are key components of this success:

* Cultivate Self-Awareness
* Understand one's key strengths
* Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
* Ownership over one's learning
* Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
* Express one's own story and strengths
* Manage stress effectively

### Gear Up
#### StrengthsFinder Reflection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_session.md)

This gear up was really nice as it helped me be reminded of my strengths and being proud of them. My strengths include, but are not limited to, being a Learner, Connectedness, Empathy, Individualization and Restorative. I was able to remind myself that I can go back to these strengths during times of challenge and feel proud of my accomplishments.

#### Learning to Pair

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)

This gear up was really valuable. Each partner I had this mod was really different; from communication styles, to learning styles, to abilities and understandings, to working habits- all comparatively to my own. I found myself trying to balance my partners and support them while also seeking their support in the learning process. I plan to take the lessons that I learned from those experiences and use them to my benefit in my future pairings.

#### Feedback I

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/feedback_i.md)

This gear up was enlightening for me, as I became more self aware of how I receive feedback. It is helpful for me to be more aware of those things so that I may strive to be a better person overall. 


#### Storytelling & Strengths

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

Storytelling can be tough and I'm thankful to have the space to practice our stories in order to refine them. Having a clearer understanding of why I'm on the path that I am on will only help me communicate that to others in the future as well as myself. I'm continuing to think about how I want to craft myself as well as my story as I move on.


#### Developer Identity

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/developer_identity.md)

It became clear during this gear up that an online presence is essential to networking and getting our name out there for our web development careers. This is the first career move that I have had to be conscious of my online presence and it was helpful to have professionals guide us through the process of what's important and what needs to change.  


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Ways that I supported the larger Turing community included being active in SAB, initiating conversations during our Friday retros with our cohort to get to know each other better, being an active participant during Bronze FE and encouraging others to join, pairing with other students and instructors, as well as picking up after the building if something needs to be done.
