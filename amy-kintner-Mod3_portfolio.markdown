## Areas of Emphasis

They hype concerning the difficulty of Mod 3 had me a bit worried, but I found that what difficulty there was stemmed more from the consistent pace and caliber of the work required and expected than the type or complexity of the work itself. My main focus for this Mod was leanring the ins and outs of API creation and consumption, with almost equal focus on learning OAuth procedures and principles. The idea of being able to consume external APIs was (and continues to be) somewhat thrilling, especially as I continued to delve into more what was actually out there, which, as it turns out, is a LOT. I enjoy variety and choice, so feeling that the world of APIs is now open for my use makes me giddy (well, almost giddy).

## A: End of Module Assessment



#### Notes from Casey:
* No need to have flash messages in your API controller; we just want to return JSON
* Also, no need to set instance variables in your API controller either
* Like that you have a test for your service, I don't see a test for your `Store` PORO though
* I suggest breaking your `Faraday.get` into a few different pieces rather than concatenating a big, long string.
* You aren't grabbing the "total stores"; you've got that hardcoded to 16.
* You also aren't grabbing all the stores, you're only grabbing 1 upon each request
* I don't know what the initialize method is doing in your `BestBuyService` - you don't need this!
* I suggest using VCR to test your API calls rather than hitting it every time.
* Also - be sure to *only* use Capybara (visiting the page) in your feature tests and not in your request specs.

#### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

#### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

We had two opportunities for indidivudal work this Mod: the APICurious project in week 2, and the final project in weeks 5 and 6. Originally, I was extremely excited for the time to do some work alone again, but I found that we still clumped into groups that more or less worked "together" in both cases. For the first project, there were five of us who chose to take on Reddit's Oauth API, and we consistently worked with each other and shared any breakthroughs. For the final project, I voluntarily paired with a Front_ender, which was aimed to allow me some hand's on time with React (this ended up not coming entirely to fruition for a variety of reasons, but c'est la vie). 

#### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/ReReddit)

This project was designed for us to consume an external API's OAuth procedures and accomplish a set variety of exercises with the data then available from the API endpoints for that site. I picked Reddit, which was the "hard" choice, and ended up being, indeed, hard. I didn't quite complete all of the available endpoints for the project, but I learned a lot, which went on to serve me well in the large group project in weeks 3 and 4, during which I volunteered to tackle all of the OAuth procedures required for our new site. 

#### Free-Degree-Finder

* [Backend GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/free_college_app)
* [Frontend GitHub URL](https://github.com/noahpeden/free-college-abroad)

For our final project, I worked with Noah Peden on making an app that will display information about countries around the world that offer some kind of undergradaute degree for free (or at least relatively free compared to the costs of such educaiton in the US). This project was inspired by the fact that there are more than a dozen countries around the world that offer free tuition for undergraduate degrees, and a great many classes at these colleges are  taught in English. This site was built in React Redux with a backend set up in Rails 5 and Postgresql. Based on user input, the site grabs university options in a particular country and lists some basic information, along with a link to the university.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two opportunities for group work this Mod: the RailsEngine project in week 1, and Cloney Island in weeks 3 and 4. Both of these groups - Laszlo and I for the first, and the all-lady group for the second - were amazing. 

#### RailsEngine

#### Pinspiration

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/pinspiration)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island#teams)

The goal of this project was to clone a new platform from scratch. Within it, we built a well-documented API to both internally consume data and provide users with a developer option and web-tokens for API access. Our group's platform to clone, Pinterest, was built to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users with either pinterest credentials or Google Oauth credentials, and admins). The database for our app ended up being quite complex, as all of the items - pins, boards, likes, comments - were interrelated and tied to a user's credentials, thus the database ended up being a platform for us to explore polymorphic associations. Additionally, the visual layout of Pinterest provided us with an opportunity to delve deep into styling, masonry, and image hosting. 
#### Technical Evaluation
**Client Expectations**

*   Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
   *   3.5: As expected, but great

**User Experience**

*   Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
   *   4: Better than expected

**Organization**

*   Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
   *   4: Better than expected

**Git Workflow**

*   Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.
   *   3.5: Better than expected

**Test Quality**

*   Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?
   *   4: Better than expected

   *   3: As expected


## D: Professional Skills

This mod's professional development focus was on the job hunt, including research and interview strategies. All of our profesisonal dvelopment material was sent in a private repo to Meg Stewart for evaultation.

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission. The more diverse the field at Turing becomes, the most diverse the entire population in the tech industry becomes - at least thats the goal. The actual implementation of this becomes incredibly complex, especially at a school that has admissions requirements: do you sacrifice admissions requirements for diversity, do you sacrifice diversity for admission of people who come from some background that might help them be successful, do you bring in people who are underrepresented and then strand them because their background isnâ€™t conducive to this kind of knowledge and career? And more generally, how does a school achieve diversity while still bringing in people who can succeed in this career path? Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions? In general, I think diversity quotas is a terrible name for a good idea; as we know from genetics, diversity leads to strength in a variety of ways, the most basic being increased chances of survival. By labeling this as a quota, it automatically points towards the ruling class, whatever that may be in the situation, as the folks with the power to dictate the quota and fill it. I think the very idea of a diversity quota is gendered male and racially white, which is part of what breeds resentment about the term.

#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

This is a serious topic, and I'm super glad we covered it. It's not something that I've actually spent a tremendous amount of time thinking about, though the discussion we had in class certainly piqued my interest. In general, I'm of the mind that increased automation is not the best choice because it will certainly - and has already - take away jobs, and the jobs it will take away first are the ones that presenlty belong to the lower-income classes around the world, and they're the most likely to suffer the most and NOT be able to quickly rebound if those jobs disappear. Our group immediately jumped into discussion of Universal Basic Income as a bandaid, and we had some robust arguments about the issue, including: where will the money come from? how will it motivate people? what will it motivate people to do? who server to benefit the most from it and why? And I'm going to save more of this discusion for the next bit because we jumped straight into the heart of the matter in the next gear up.

ALRIGHT, UBI. Socialism. Star Trek, here we come.
