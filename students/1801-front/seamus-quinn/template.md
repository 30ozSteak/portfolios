# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Mod1 very excited and nervous to learn code. My goals were as follows: work as hard as I can every day, learn voraciously, push myself to be the best learner I can be, and to view failure as an opportunity, not a hindrance.  My goals are process oriented, not outcome oriented.  I feel as though I have accomplished all of my goals.
