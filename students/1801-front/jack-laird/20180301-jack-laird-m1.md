# Jack Laird - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For module 1 I set out to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as git and gitHub. I also wanted to focus on building relationships through pairing and helping classmates

## A: End of Module Assessment

TBD

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work and projects consisted of Number Guesser, the first project of the mod that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and three static comp projects. The static comp projects are each comp recreations that require you to follow a certain format but give you liberties on certain parts of the design. They're intended to keep you working on your HTML and CSS abilities while allowing you to use a little JavaScript. Each comp grows in complexity and pushes you to extend your knowledge in both CSS and HTMl. Learning these skills is crucial to being a developer because often times you are asked to recreate a design down to the pixel.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects consisted of LinkedList, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox. Each project built upon the JavaScript skills learned in the previous project as well as challenged you to work with a new partner each time. The paired projects also expanded upon HTML and CSS skills but the main focus of these projects is on refining JavaScript or JQuery skills and using GitHub for collaboration. The final project 2DoBox required you to add new features to IdeaBox using another persons code base. Using someone elses code teaches you to think about problems in a different way and how add new features to a site without scrapping the code base. 

#### LinkedList
