## A: End of Module Assessment

TBD

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work and projects consisted of Number Guesser, the first project of the mod that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and three static comp projects. The static comp projects are each comp recreations that require you to follow a certain format but give you liberties on certain parts of the design. They're intended to keep you working on your HTML and CSS abilities while allowing you to use a little JavaScript. Each comp grows in complexity and pushes you to extend your knowledge in both CSS and HTMl. Learning these skills is crucial to being a developer because often times you are asked to recreate a design down to the pixel.
