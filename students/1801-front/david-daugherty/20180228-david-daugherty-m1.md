# David Daugherty - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During this module I set out to try and absorb as much knowledge as possible. I wanted to build a solid foundation so that later down the line I can go proform better once we get into more complex things. I set out to take this opportunity as serious as possible to gain the most out of this school. I knew going in that this was going to be hard and there will be moments where I may struggle but I wanted to keep an optimistic attitude for what my future will hold when I finish Turing.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pending - Although I believe I fulfilled all the requirements to move on to Mod 2.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were the Number Guesser and the three Static Comp Challenges.

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

For my number guesser I created a number guessing game where you have to guess a number between 10 and 100 with only 10 tries. I later added a level increase after every correct guess increasing the number by 10 after each win.

Through phase II + extension

## COMP RECREATION / DESIGN

use button tag instead of input[type=button]
don't use header tags when the content is not a header


## CSS

* Proficient  


## JS/jQuery

* Advanced Beginner  
move code you use more than once into a function e.g. generate random number code

## Surprise and Delight (reminder: have fun!)

* Sparkles  
Love the window frame and the game

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### (Static Comp One)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/dd-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For the first static comp I was asked to create a metro style layout where tiles needed to be re-arranged to create a responsive design.

My feedback was limited to making my icons a bit smaller and making the text a bit bigger in some of the smaller screens

#### (Static Comp Two)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/DD-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

For the second static comp I was asked to create a card style layout similar to those like pintrest. The site needed to be fully responsive. 

The feedback that I recieved was that I neede to check smaller phone sizes than iPhone 7 because it didn't scroll right on the iPhone 5. Another was to use aria better.

#### (Static Comp Three)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/DD-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)
