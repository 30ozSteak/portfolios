## Areas of Emphasis

During this module I set out to try and absorb as much knowledge as possible. I wanted to build a solid foundation so that later down the line I can go and proform better once we get into more complex things. I set out to take this opportunity as serious as possible to gain the most out of this school. I knew going in that this was going to be hard and there will be moments where I may struggle but I wanted to keep an optimistic attitude for what my future will hold when I finish Turing. I know I tend to keep to myself a lot so I may not be as active in the community as I should but should I move on I want to start doing some lunch and learns to help boost the design skills of my peers.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass - I believe I fulfilled all the requirements to move on to Mod 4.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I completed this Mod were SwapiBox and my Personal Project.

#### SwapiBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/Swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/daughedm/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-3/swapi/doc/scores.md)


For Sorting Suite I was tasked to create 4 sorting algorithms. The four were Bubble, Insertion, Merge and Quick. In this we really learned about the process of breaking down complex problems and solving piece by piece.

#### Personal Project - Sportsball

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/daughedm/front-end-submissions-public/tree/master/1801/mod-3/personal-projects)

For Sportsball I created an application for people who want to know the bare minimum about what happened with their favorite baseball team the day before. The app takes in baseball data from the sportsradar api and then cleans and repurposes that data into small digestable bits so a person can have a conversation about the game without actually knowing much at all. In this project I used react, redux and router.

**Process:** 3  
**Fundamental JavaScript & Style:** 3  
**Test-Driven Development & Code Sanitation:** 4  
**Functional Expectations:** 4  

**Feedback:**  
Whiteboard adding words  
good process, pretty good use of vocab  
Whiteboard suggest  
ok use of vocab, good understanding, good process  
Whiteboard a new method select  
Good process - start with end in mind  
had clear process  
ok vocab  
Write tests for select  
good understanding of what to test  
good testing philosophy - start with small test cases  
Implement select  

## C: Group Work & Projects

The group projects I completed this Mod were HeadCount and Movie-Tracker.

### Projects

#### Head-Count

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmcjunkinmarquis/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/daughedm/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-3/headcount/saemus-theresa-doc/scores.md)

For gametime Ryan and I were tasked to create the game Tron using HTML canvas and and javascript. I was very pleased with the way it turned out and was able to learn about utilizing classes. We ended up tying for first at the code fair with this game.

**Evaluator: Will**  

**Functional Expectations:** 3+  
**Testing:** 3+  
**JavaScript Style:** A3 
**Application Organization:** 3 
**Workflow:** 3  

**Feedback:**  
Great division of functionality.

#### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/daughedm/Movie-Tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/daughedm/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1801/mod-3/movie-tracker/sage-doc-alan/scores.md)

This was the first time using react and I can honestly say that it was an enjoyable experience although it came with quite a bit of learning curve. Once I started to usderstand the concepts of state and passing props and when to create a new component the process all seemed to come together. 

**Evaluator: Will**  

**Specification Adherence:** 4  
**User Interface:** 4  
**HTML Style:** 4  
**CSS/Sass Style:** 4  
**JavaScript / React Style:** 3  
**Testing & Sanitation:** 2  
**Workflow:** 3   

**Feedback:**  
military time -> regular time  
half the tests failing  
event prevent default should be in search component  
long if statement in DataSanatizer, refactor that  
can convert stateless components that use classes into stateless components that's just a function  


## D: Professional Skills
This mod, we learned about ways to manage stress, working with people who have varying personality types, and getting out of a fixed mindset.

### Gear Up
#### Micro-Agression

In this session we really got to know our mod on a personal level. We talked about certain privalage and how it effects out lives. We also talked about being empathetic towards those with less privalage. Overall it was a great discussion that really allowed us as a group to come together a learn more about eachother than just on a superficial level.

#### Group Think

In this session we learned about group think and how it affects a sort a echo effect in the way we think. We discussed ways to avoid it and about what is and is'nt groupthink. It was a great discussion about whether its always a bad thing and and way we could implement ways at Turing to avoid it.

#### AI

In this session we talked about all teh diiferent ways technology is effection medicine in the world. We also discussed ethical delemmas that come about with the advancement in medicine and how we would deal with it. It was cool to see where the medicine field is heading and how there will be a big change coming where we change from reactive medicine to proactive medicine.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
Overall, I feel like I did an adequate job of being involved in the Turing community. I took advantage of pairings when needed and reached out to alums for help. I helped classmates with their projects when I could help and tried to attend a few social gatherings when I could. For the next mod I'm challenging myself to become more invovled in the community by helping others in the mods below me as well as trying to be more social and connecting with other mods other than my own. I have been toying around with an idea to have a design workshop over lunch to help turing students who struggle with design. I have noticed in my time here that design is often considered an afterthought but it can be a big asset in getting you work noticed for potential jobs.
