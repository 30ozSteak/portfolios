# Tyler McNamara - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I was hoping to get a good grasp of the basics of programming and begin to change the way I think to one of a developer. I understand that working in a team and with partners will be the norm after landing a job in the field so learning how to use Github was a priority of mine as well.
