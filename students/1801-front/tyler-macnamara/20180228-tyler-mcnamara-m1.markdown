# Tyler McNamara - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I made a commitment to myself that I was going to work as hard as possible to succeed in this program which meant making sacrifices in other aspects of my life so that I could completely focus on programming. I didn't have any previous programming experience so wasn't sure how I would do at Turing but didn't want to fail because of a lack of effort. 

This module I was hoping to get a good grasp of the basics of programming and begin to change the way I think to one of a developer. I understand that working in a team and with partners will be the norm after landing a job in the field so learning how to use Github was a priority of mine as well. Learning how to correctly implement HTML, CSS, and JS in combination was another area of emphasis for me.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I feel that I passed this module based on my strong project evals throughout the module as well as solid peformance in the finall assessments. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I truly did enjoy working on the projects throughout the mod. What I enjoyed the most was taking what I learned in class and by reading the lessons and implementing these knowledge into an actual project. I am able concentrate more effectively when I work alone which I enjoyed about the individual projects although the partner projects were very beneficial when running into issues that were difficult to resolve alone. 

#### Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project required us to create a game where the user must guess a number originally between 0 - 100 and then between a range selected by the user. If a number was entered or it was outside of the range it would alert the user that they needed to select a number within the range. Once the user guessed the number correct a modal would pop up asking if they wanted to play again, if they did then the range would expand by 10 on both ends. 

I really enjoyed this project because it was the first time applying what we learned in class to an actual project with a visual result. It was difficult understanding how to get started but once I got moving I found that I was able to grasp how to complete the project without a great deal of difficulty, although looking back there were definitely things I could have done to refactor the code. Passing in paramaters was also difficult for me to grasp during this project.

For this static comp we needed to recreate a design that included a large image on the right and a bunch of smaller boxes on the left hand side. Laying out the desktop version wasn't as difficult as deciding how to layout the mobile version and actually implementing that design. I chose to take a diffirent route to the mobile version and turned the large right side image into the background and enlarged the box with text and a link as well as put an opacity on it. The other boxes and made smaller and placed them below.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Static comp two involved designing a page that had a header with a bunch of cards below. This seemed like th eperfect opportunity to use grid as the cards were all the same size and spaced equally apart.
