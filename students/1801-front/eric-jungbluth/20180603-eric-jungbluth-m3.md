# Eric Jungbluth - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I knew this module was very react heavy, so it was one of my goals to get very comfortable with react. I also wanted to get better at testing, and that was one of the things I probably worked the hardest on this module. I didn't know it at the time, but I also found it important to get a good understanding of redux and react-router as well.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass. Will gave me a little feedback, but said he didn't see anything in my code that he was concerned about.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The two individual projects this mod were SWAPI-Box and my personal project. I feel really good about both of them. SWAPI-Box was the first time I hit an extension (router) at Turing. That was a good feeling, but it was even better for me to know that I'm finally reaching the point where I can have a short lesson on something and then just use the docs to immediately implement it in a project. My personal project I'm proud of because I was able to struggle with and implement both the Google maps api and Firebase. Knowing I can get through things like that with just docs and no outside help has really improved my confidence. I came into Turing with no prior coding experience, and I'm finally starting to feel like I really get it.

#### SWAPI-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/swapi)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

A react app that pulls in Star Wars data for planets, people, etc, and displays it. Also allows the user to "favorite" those cards and store them. I learned to work with nested fetch calls on this project, and really leveled-up my knowledge of testing.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I guess the biggest way I participated was by leading one session of iron-fe every week of the mod. I also paired with mod2 students a few times throughout the mod, to help them with either projects or array prototypes.
