# Eric Jungbluth - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I knew this module was very react heavy, so it was one of my goals to get very comfortable with react. I also wanted to get better at testing, and that was one of the things I probably worked the hardest on this module. I didn't know it at the time, but I also found it important to get a good understanding of redux and react-router as well.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass. I got a little feedback from Will, but other than that he said he didn't see anything in my code that he was concerned about.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The two individual projects this mod were SWAPI-Box and my personal project. I feel really good about both of them. SWAPI-Box was the first time I hit an extension (router) at Turing. That was a good feeling, but it was even better for me to know that I'm finally reaching the point where I can have a short lesson on something and then just use the docs to immediately implement it in a project. My personal project I'm proud of because I was able to struggle with and implement both the Google maps api and Firebase. Knowing I can get through things like that with just docs and no outside help has really improved my confidence. I came into Turing with no prior coding experience, and I'm finally starting to feel like I really get it.

#### SWAPI-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/swapi)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

A react app that pulls in Star Wars data for planets, people, etc, and displays it. Also allows the user to "favorite" those cards and store them. I learned to work with nested fetch calls on this project, and really leveled-up my knowledge of testing.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Our two group projects this module were Headcount and MovieTracker. Headcount used school district data to display cards, with the ability to compare cards. MovieTracker uses an api to bring in current movie data and displays that information, with the ability for users to log in and store favorite movies.

#### Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0/scores.md)

Headcount uses school district data to display cards, with the ability to compare cards. This was our second time making a react app and got us all more comfortable with both using react and testing react.

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker/scores.md)

A React app that pulls movie data from an API and displays current movies, with functionality for users to log in and save favorites. This was my first time using Redux and Postgres.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I guess the biggest way I participated was by leading one session of iron-fe every week of the mod. I also paired with mod2 students a few times throughout the mod, to help them with either projects or array prototypes.
