# Eric Jungbluth - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I knew this module was very react heavy, so it was one of my goals to get very comfortable with react. I also wanted to get better at testing, and that was one of the things I probably worked the hardest on this module. I didn't know it at the time, but I also found it important to get a good understanding of redux and react-router as well.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass. Will gave me a little feedback, but said he didn't see anything in my code that he was concerned about.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The two individual projects this mod were SWAPI-Box and my personal project. I feel really good about both of them. SWAPI-Box was the first time I hit an extension (router) at Turing. That was a good feeling, but it was even better for me to know that I'm finally reaching the point where I can have a short lesson on something and then just use the docs to immediately implement it in a project. My personal project I'm proud of because I was able to struggle with and implement both the Google maps api and Firebase. Knowing I can get through things like that with just docs and no outside help has really improved my confidence. I came into Turing with no prior coding experience, and I'm finally starting to feel like I really get it.

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

* 4- - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

### CSS/Design

* 4- - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

* 4- - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

* 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Workflow

- 3.5 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.


## Surprise and Delight
- 2 - Sparkles


#### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/EricMellow/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

A React app that pulls movie data from an API and displays current movies, with functionality for users to log in and save favorites. This was my first time using Redux and Postgres.

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

- 3+ - The application completes all 2 iterations.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4- - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates
- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 3+: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I guess the biggest way I participated was by leading one session of iron-fe every week of the mod. I also paired with mod2 students a few times throughout the mod, to help them with either projects or array prototypes.
