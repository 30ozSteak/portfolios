# Eric Jungbluth - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Having absolutely no coding experience, I set out to get a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as good understanding of basic JavaScript functionality. My goal was to put my head down and work hard, so I could stay ahead of the avalanche of knowledge and work. I feel good about the way the mod went, and think I did a good job of accomplishing the above goals.
