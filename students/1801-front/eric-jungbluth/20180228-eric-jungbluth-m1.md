# Eric Jungbluth - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Having absolutely no coding experience, I set out to get a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as good understanding of basic JavaScript functionality. My goal was to put my head down and work hard, so I could stay ahead of the avalanche of knowledge and work. I feel good about the way the mod went, and think I did a good job of accomplishing the above goals.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

For mod 1 we had one individual project, as well as three static compositions. The project was a simple number guesser game site and the three static compositions were of increasing difficulity.

### Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Project description
The base requirement for this project was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. It needed to have an input field for guessing the number, a button for submitting a guess, a button for clearing the input field, and a button that resets the game. It also needed to display the user's most recent guess and display a feedback hint to direct them for their next guess. There were two more phases that added increasing functionality, as well as a final extension phase if you had time.

### Static Comps Project Description
For these project we were given an image for a website and were expcted to recreate it as closely as possible. We were given creative license on the photos and copy, however the objective was to build something that respects the integrity of the original design as far as choice in layout, spacing, font, etc. The comp also needed to be responsive, and have a reasonable amount of ARIA accessibility.
