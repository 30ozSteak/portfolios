# Eric Jungbluth - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Having absolutely no coding experience, I set out to get a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as good understanding of basic JavaScript functionality. My goal was to put my head down and work hard, so I could stay ahead of the avalanche of knowledge and work. I feel good about the way the mod went, and think I did a good job of accomplishing the above goals.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

For mod 1 we had one individual project, as well as three static compositions. The project was a simple number guesser game site and the three static compositions were of increasing difficulity.

### Number Guesser

#### Project description
The base requirement for this project was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. It needed to have an input field for guessing the number, a button for submitting a guess, a button for clearing the input field, and a button that resets the game. It also needed to display the user's most recent guess and display a feedback hint to direct them for their next guess. There were two more phases that added increasing functionality, as well as a final extension phase if you had time.
