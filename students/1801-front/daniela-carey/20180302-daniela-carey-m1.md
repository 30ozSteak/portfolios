##### Partner: Tyler McNamara
##### Evaluator: David Whitaker

##### Notes/What To Work On:
###### html
* nice work using aria labels
* great naming conventions
* default to using classes instead of ids for reusability
###### css
* 0 not 0px
* consider adding organizational comments for each page component
* consider using bem (takes away from the cognitive load of naming things)
* default to classes instead of ids and comma separated selectors
* consider loading only one style sheet in the head and import all others
###### js
* No need for most comments
* Try leveraging parameters and arguments in place of global variables
* Think in terms of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - each function name should say exactly what the function does.
###### git/github
* loved seeing 50 commits
* say a little more

##### Feedback from Tyler: 
> “I think Daniela did a great job on this project. She was willing to work hard and opened up her schedule so that we were able to complete a good portion of it within the first couple days. She had a great grasp on the javascript / JQuery fundamentals so that we were able to jump into the project without needing to coach each other much & when we came across a problem neither of us could solve we worked well together to find a solution. There were only a couple improvements I could offer, ones that I need work on as well which this first pairing process taught me, become more comfortable with Github so partners work more efficiently when apart and double check for any issues in the code before completing the project. Great first pairing experience and very happy with the final product!”

_Partner:_ Jack Laird
_Evaluator:_ David Whitaker

##### Notes/What To Work On:
##### Functional Expectations
* Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

##### HTML
###### Accessibility
* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
use aria-label for input elements / buttons
###### Style
* Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

##### CSS
###### Structure of Code
* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
###### Implementation
* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
look into using vendor prefixes for transition e.g. -moz-, -webkit-

##### JAVASCRIPT
###### Data Types
* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.
* Exceptional Can assess and implement data type decisions for implementation based on increasing performance, shoring up code to be concise/clean, and composing for future maintainability.
###### Conditional Logic
* Novice Can understand when an expression evaluates to true or false.
* Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.
* Proficient Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
* Exceptional Can write conditional logic that is succinct and easy to read. Logic can handle all situations where user gives incorrect/unexpected input.
###### Functions & Scope
* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* don't recreate objects when you can use the original e.g ideaToStore in setInLocalStorage
###### Arrays
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
save one key to localstorage where the value is an array of ideas
use forEach to iterate over the contents of an array
###### Objects & Prototypes
* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* localstorage methods
* DOM Manipulation
* Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style
* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* rename IdeaFactory to Idea
* refactor setInLocalStorage, don't need to create a new object.

##### GIT & GITHUB
###### Git
* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
###### Github
* Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

##### DESIGN
###### Comp Recreation
* Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

##### PAIRING
###### Collaboration
* Proficient Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

##### Feedback from Jack: 
> "Working with you on IdeaBox was really fun! Your ability to self teach new concepts and implement them was a huge part of why we were able to get so much done on our project. I found that we were able to get along well and this both helped and hurt our efficiency throughout the work process. I felt really comfortable trying new things and bouncing ideas off you. I would also get distracted talking to you about something off topic but I believe that this served as a nice break from our task. You always were able to work around my schedule and I really appreciated your adaptability. I felt like I got left behind when you wrote the search function and I never got a full explanation on it. We worked on almost every other aspect of our script together so our communication on that particular function was a little less natural. In the future I’d suggest making sure that your partner understands something you did on your own before moving on. Working with you really helped me to develop my ability to collaboratively problem solve and I feel a lot more fluent in JavaScript and Jquery. I enjoyed being partnered with you and hope we are paired up again in the future!"
