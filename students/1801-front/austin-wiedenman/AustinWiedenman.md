## B: Individual Work & Projects

My main focus during my group projects this mod was to spend time learning all of the things that I was unable to grasp last mod, which was a great deal.  This mod I was able to spend more time, during the one project that my partner was involved, learing their work styles and really enjoyed being able to work throuhg problems together to strengthen my understang of javascript.

it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.

In it’s simplest form, the application to store website links.
In it's simplest for it must include two input fields, One for the title of the bookmark, One for the URL that the bookmark should link to, One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page, and section for all of the created bookmarks. Each bookmark should display,The title of the bookmark, The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL), A button to “Mark as Read”, A button to “Remove” the bookmark. 

"Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three. Mostly through phase four links don't work - pay attention to details"

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Working in pairs is more complex than meets the eye.  I only really had one project this mod that my partner was involved in.  Woking with Krista was a great expereince.  She is extremely introverted in her working style and I am an extreme extrovert.  I think that we were able to overcome our differences in working styles throuhg clear and honest communication.

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we built an application for recording and archiving our ideas and indicating whether or not they were good or bad. Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

"Hooray for body text not falling out of container when there are large amounts of text!
Update CSS to make save button appear disabled
Buggy - search sort of works, new line character showing up in local storage, persistUserData causing problems
Nice job with organizing rules in CSS - easy to follow"

This project consisted of use taking the code from a pair of classmates and refactoring it. We were instructed to pivot the project into another project, were we created a platform that houses a to-do list in local storage. We also worked to better the ux/iu design and to add additional functionality to the filter.
