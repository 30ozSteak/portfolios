# Stephanie Ospina - M4 Portfolio

## - An overview of your experience of module 4 - 2 paragraphs. (What did you like? Do you have any constructive feedback for module 4?)

- I didn't expect that mod 4 was going to be so intense, there were a lot of new concepts and technologies and I think the timelines for the projects were very short plus We had to make time to find jobs... it was a lot and I wish we had more time and less stress to learn the backend. 

The instructors as always were great, they knew how stressed we were and found ways to kept us motivated, they were also very supportive. So good job there! but yeah I think that the program can be modified a little bit to give the backend the importance it deserves and to give students more time to focus on jobs.

## An overview of your experience at Turing overall - 2 paragraphs. (What would you keep from your Turing experience? What would you wish that was different for future Turing students?)

- Overall I think Turing was great, I got to learn so many things that include not just coding but things about the tech industry, how to work with others and how to learn. I got to meet great people, to learn from others and also help and support others.

I got to challenge myself and really identify my strengths and opportunities, I feel like after Turing I'm way more confident.

For future students.. I hope Mod 2 becomes more productive and Mod 4 less stressful. But besides that Turing is awesome! 

## The experience of your first week on the job - a few paragraphs. (What did you feel prepared for? What did you not feel prepared for? What was the experience like meeting your team, diving into a new code base? Tell us a story about what the week was like.)

- My first week....Since HP is such a big company and we're working on a project for the IheartMedia which is also a huge company, my first week and second one and I think all my weeks are going to be full of meetings :'). We get assign a story every Thursday, so we have 3 days to complete it. So far (specially after going to Turing) I feel like it's a good timeline since the stories are very specific. 

For this project the client is using Angular, Lodash and TypeScript, I haven't use any of these technologies so when I saw the code I was like :o! so it took me a couple days to understand it.

For my first story I was assigned something that sound very basic: Add additional checkbox in UI and only enabled when Copy Revision is selected / set to true. But after looking at the app and the code I proposed a whole different way to do it, the story is now bigger and harder but the app's UX is gonna be better. 

So to summarize I feel like Turing prepared me for the most important things: 1. learn new stuff quickly, 2. follow timelines and work fast, 3. Think about UX/UI and not just code.
