# Megan Kaiser - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn as much as I could which I think I did and get better at the things I knew already so they wouldn't use my cognitive resources as much during the rest of my time at Turing.

## A: End of Module Assessment

pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The personal projects I did this mod I focused on personal learning and doing it different than the prevoius mod. I pushed myself to finish phase four for very project. I did this on all of my personal projects.

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. I went to phase four and make a unicorn game for kids to play. 

##### evaluation comments:
Loved Unicorn Guesser! Very cool extension! Also, cool that you got the 'done' button working!
Code for phases 1-3 looked clean
css-consider organizational comments
js-try finding duplicate lines of code and breaking out into functions

It was hard to not work with someone on this project, when asking for help no one knew my code well enough to actully help.

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike). Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

##### evaluation comments: 
Refactored too much, shouldn't be getting rid of global variables. I had some duplicate lines of code due to the no global varibles.

##### description: 
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked to learn about my partners working style. I learned aboout white boarding with Hannah and how to work on different things at the same time with Jack.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mrayanne113/linkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

##### description:
It’s time to try your hand at building a small application to store website links.
In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:Two input fields, One for the title of the bookmark, One for the URL that the bookmark should link to, One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page, A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display: The title of the bookmark, The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL), A button to “Mark as Read”, A button to “Remove” the bookmark

##### evaluation comments: 
Through Phase 4 with some bugs,
Clear read bookmarks button not working,
Thank you for bringing your notebooks and taking notes for the verbal feedback during eval - keep it up,
Nice job with README

#### 2doBox

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

##### description: 
For this project we were given code from a pair of classmates that created idea box. We were instructed to pivot the project into another project, were we created a platform that houses a to-do list. We also added new features including better ux/iu design of disabling the save button when there is insufficient information in inputs as well as created a completed check button for when the user has finished the task.

##### feedback to me:

## D: Professional Skills
I find all of the PD sessions very helpful the first time around. I learned that my strengths from strength finder are very close to the truth and repaeting I realized how I should have used them better the first time in mod one. I feel like I had a strong Linkedin and Twitter before I got here. And I made my github strong over break using the things we learned, so this time around I had almost no changes to make. I know I need to work on making my story more me and less scripted so thats my plan during the week off, to nail that down.

### Gear Ups

 ###### Stress Mgmt 101
 Redoing this gear up didn't make me feel as stressed as last time. It was good to revisit stress but I still feel like the gear up was more stressful to talk about things that make you feel stressed. It was nice to actully remember things we learned about the brain instead of just knowing we talked about, but this time I can remember the hind, mid, and frontal cortex. My window of tolerance is very low for stress right now because I'm putting too pressure on repeating in regrauds to the rest of my life and I need to work on that still. 
 
 ###### Working Styles
 I have never viewed myself anything other than introvert, just I'm starting to realize that you aren't one thing all the time. You can one way at work but another at home, etc. I was shocked that I wasn't a straight introvert but actaully right down the middle. I'm flexible at a lot of things but going full extrovert isn't something I think I will over come in the next few months but one day I will be able too. 
 
 ###### Getting Better at Doing Difficult Things
 It was super cool to watch that video and learn about cognitive resources. I feel the resources I use on javascript are so much smaller now thah last mod. I don't have to think about git and only had one git merge error all mod and compared to last mod when it was very week. My emotional state this mod has been all over and I really need to nail that down for success in mod 2. I am trying to use my growth midset with what we learned at this session and work on making my cognitive resources smaller everyday.
 
 ###### Mod4 Lead Gear Up: Introvert to Influencer	
 It was instreting to learning about coming out of my shell by watching a video that told me to fake it until I become it. Which I thought was crappy advice but my boyfriend says I'm wrong in that and she was right. I should just fake it, but sounds horrible to me but I'm trying find a middle way so I don't feel like a imposter the rest of my life.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This time since I was repeating, I speant a lot of time helping my classmates. I was a TA for try turing one weekend. I lead a study session this last weekend for my classmates, in which we went over wish list as a group. I have been a shoulder to cry on and people who have choosen to repeat are asking me for advice. And as always I continue to tell people about turing and hand out some card to people.
