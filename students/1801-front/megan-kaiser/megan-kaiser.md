## B: Individual Work & Projects

The personal projects I did this mod I focused on personal learning and doing it different than the prevoius mod.

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. I went to phase four and make a unicorn game for kids to play. 

##### evaluation comments:
Loved Unicorn Guesser! Very cool extension! Also, cool that you got the 'done' button working!
Code for phases 1-3 looked clean
css-consider organizational comments
js-try finding duplicate lines of code and breaking out into functions

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mrayanne113/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### description: 
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike). Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

##### evaluation comments: 
Refactored too much, shouldn't be getting rid of global variables. I had some duplicate lines of code due to the no global varibles.

##### description: 
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mrayanne113/linkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

##### description:
With a little jQuery under your belt, it’s time to try your hand at building a small application to store website links.
In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:Two input fields, One for the title of the bookmark, One for the URL that the bookmark should link to, One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page, A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display: The title of the bookmark, The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL), A button to “Mark as Read”, A button to “Remove” the bookmark

##### evaluation comments: 
Through Phase 4 with some bugs,
Clear read bookmarks button not working,
Thank you for bringing your notebooks and taking notes for the verbal feedback during eval - keep it up,
Nice job with README

##### feedback to me:
“Working on LinkedList together was really fun. Your knowledge on jQuery and Javascript was a huge part on why we were able to finish all four phases and get some extra features in our project as well. You were always willing to sit down and talk me through the functionality of our script, which I really appreciated. At times, I felt like I was a little behind when you would figure out a new aspect of our project and I didn’t always want to slow down our development to ask questions about your techniques. I should’ve approached you more, your willingness to help me was always very thorough. Our communication throughout the process was a little too laid-back and we probably could have benefitted from some more time working together. I would suggest finding that time in the future and making sure your partner understands the code before moving on to the next task. You are incredible at breaking down your thought process, so your partner will have no trouble understanding how you did things. Thanks to you, my understanding of jQuery has grown exponentially and I feel much more comfortable developing the functionality of my webpage. I really enjoyed working with you and hope that we get paired up together on another project!”

#### 2doBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mrayanne113/2dobox_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

##### description: 
For this project we were given code from a pair of classmates that created idea box. We were instructed to pivot the project into another project, were we created a platform that houses a to-do list. We also added new features including better ux/iu design of disabling the save button when there is insufficient information in inputs as well as created a completed check button for when the user has finished the task.

##### feedback to me:

## D: Professional Skills
I find all of the PD sessions very helpful 

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

 ###### Stress Mgmt 101
 Redoing this gear up didn't make me feel as stressed as last time. It was good to revisit stress but I still feel like the gear up was more stressful to talk about things that make you feel stressed. It was nice to actully remember things we learned about the brain instead of just knowing we talked about, but this time I can remember the hind, mid, and frontal cortex. My window of tolerance is very low for stress right now because I'm putting too pressure on repeating in regrauds to the rest of my life and I need to work on that still. 
 
 ###### Working Styles
 I have never viewed myself anything other than introvert, just I'm starting to realize that you aren't one thing all the time. You can one way at work but another at home, etc. I was shocked that I wasn't a straight introvert but actaully right down the middle. I'm flexible at a lot of things but going full extrovert

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This time since I was repeating, I speant a lot of time helping my classmates. I was a TA for try turing one weekend. I lead a study session this last weekend for my classmates. I have been a shoulder to cry on.
