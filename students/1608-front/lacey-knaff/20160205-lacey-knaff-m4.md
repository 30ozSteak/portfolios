### Gear Up

####Tragedy of the Commons
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I really enjoyed the visual aspect of learning in this gear up. I also had a great conversation with my group about the systemic bias that's engrained in our society and how we can make small changes to address it.

####Automation
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

This was kind of a scary Gear Up. I mean, I knew that automation was thing but didn't realize how far reaching it is and how much it's expected to take over in the future. We had a great discussion around how we can prepare for that future.

####Universal Basic Income
