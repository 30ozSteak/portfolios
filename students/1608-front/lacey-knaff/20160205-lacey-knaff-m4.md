# Lacey Knaff - M4 Portfolio

##Summary
Mod4 was all about the job hunt. I set out to get a job offer before the end of the module, so spent a lot of my time networking, sending cold outreach emails, prepping for interviews, and applying for jobs. It was definitely overwhelming having to try to balance both school and the job search, and I often felt like I wouldn't be able to finish the Mod.

##Areas of Emphasis
* Getting a job offer
* Learning how to set up a backend database
* Learning to make applications that use express and node
* Using Heroku for deployment

##Rubric Scores
* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.5

#####Description:
The Refactor Track was a week long project where we were allowed to do self-directed work. Each day we had a group stand up and were in charge of tracking hours and keeping on track. I used this time to clean up issues in an older project, write a blog post, network, and put together a front-end interview prep document.

PASS

### Gear Up

####Tragedy of the Commons
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I really enjoyed the visual aspect of learning in this gear up. I also had a great conversation with my group about the systemic bias that's engrained in our society and how we can make small changes to address it.

####Automation
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

This was kind of a scary Gear Up. I mean, I knew that automation was thing but didn't realize how far reaching it is and how much it's expected to take over in the future. We had a great discussion around how we can prepare for that future.

####Universal Basic Income

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

###Giving Feedback:

###Being a Community Member:
Lacey's eye and mind for design and clean code is one of the reasons I asked to pair with her this mod on my personal site. She was honest and helpful with the ideas I came up with for my own site, and helped walk me through what could be some challenges or downfalls. I think she's probably one of those developers who's going to end up getting paid buttloads cause she's basically a UX Designer with the skill set of an experienced Front End Engineer. Overall she was a pleasure to work with. -Noah Peden

###Playing a Part

###Goals
My goals for after graduation are:
* continue my education in front-end development
* stay up to date on new technologies
* network at and attend developer meetups
* work on starting my own design + development business
* learn prototyping tools like Framer.js and get better at Sketch app
* get healthy again
* use my extra free time to keep learning and growing
* start giving back to the design + development community
