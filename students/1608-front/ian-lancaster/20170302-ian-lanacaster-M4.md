Excellent project Ian, great work.

## feedback to me

Feedback from Graham:

I had the privilege of working with Ian on two projects: the Electron project and our capstone. I had an excellent experience with both. I think that he may have been my best partner at Turing (nothing against any of the others), perhaps in part because we have similar personalities and work styles in many ways. He did a lot of wizardry with the server and the SVG, and he was super collaborative and helpful when we went through our build nightmares with React Native. In terms of code, I think he should work on writing shorter, more modular functions and breaking code into more files. Overall, though, it was a great experience working with Ian.

Feedback from Lacy:

It's been really great to see Ian's growth over the course of Turing. He is an incredibly sharp and highly motivated person, who enjoys sharing his perspective and knowledge with others. I've mostly been impressed with his ability and willingness to accept feedback, positive or negative, from others and actively work on changing. I think he had some occasional struggles with group work over the course of the 7 months, but by the end it was evident that he took that feedback to heart and became a really great teammate. I think Ian is going to go on to do great things, and main hope for him is that he continues with the same penchant for continual learning and growth.


Feedback to Graham:

Finally getting to work with Graham on a couple of project this mod was a true pleasure. I donâ€™t think I have worked a more focused and diligent individual that Graham. I think he will be a true asset wherever he ends up working. Graham has found a method for writing and refactoring coded that end in a solid final product. My only, piece of advice for him would be to stop coding at certain key decision points, and consider the costs and benefits of different options. Doing this rather than taking the first path that works, could save a lot of development time down the road.
