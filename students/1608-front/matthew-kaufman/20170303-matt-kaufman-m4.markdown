# Matt Kaufman - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

This module I set out to #1 have a job before I graduated, and #2 contribute to my community at Turing in the fullest extent possible. I think I accomplished this quite well by running IronFE 4/5 days a week and getting to know some of the lower mods.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Specification Adherence

* 4: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use. Application is in production and at least one extension is completed.


### Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests and a few unit tests where appropriate.

### CSS Style

*CSS is graded on quality, not quantity. You don't need a lot of CSS to have a pleasant interface*

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.


### User Interface

* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The interface is aesthetically pleasing to the evaluator. There is good use color and whitespace. There is no point where the instructor cannot figure out how to use the application without guidance from the developer.

### Workflow

* 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### RealTime (ClaskMeAnything)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MilkMan90/realtime)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/real-time.html)

## Description

In this project, we’re going to exploring client-side security and build a real time application with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients.

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Jet Fuel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MilkMan90/JetFuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

Abstract
In this project you’ll build a URL shortener service.
Your application will allow users to create folders (like bookmark folders) to store long, ugly URLs as shortened URLs through your service.
The main goal of your application is to redirect a request at the shortened URL to their long URL equivalent. Each shortened URL should belong to a unique folder which is capable of storing N URLs.
Your secondary goal is to track URL usage and provide popularity statistics.

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)


1. Let's say tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) seek teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race). How will this impact the types of jobs available?

   This limits jobs available by a whole lot. Since 1/3 will be a most likely small segment of the population, diversity will be severely limited.

2. Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions?

  My attitude is that diversity is extremely important to well functioning teams. Having a team that is creating a product for as many people as possible benefits from having a diverse set of backgrounds and opinions. This game didn't change my assumptions, only reinforced them. I think when choosing between two equally talented technical applicants for a job, the person that will help influence a more diverse team would be the better choice.

3. Given the patterns illuminated by PotP, what other strategies may be effective in counteracting bias?

  Educating people in more diverse ways might be effective in counteracting bias. Say, if we can educate people at more diverse schools, people will be more likely to be apt to be perfectly fine with living in a diverse manner.

  Gentrifying neighborhoods may be a good method of counteracting bias, as long as people are not pushed out.

  I think economic factors are the most important as far as gentrification goes. Being "priced out" is a very common thing, in fact probably the most common. I think education is super important here. If we can educate our traditionally under-represented groups up to the best standards, we can start to bridge the gap.

4. PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, what knowledge and understandings should Turing impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission.

  Turing should be sure to have classes that show that diverse teams can make better teams than otherwise. Constantly putting students in situations where they are in diversity, while contrasting the diverse team with the homogeneous team, is important. I think showing that diverse teams are the most effective is extremely important, yet rather difficult indeed.

5. PotP is a pretty sweet example of how technology can illustrate complex ideas. What are PotP's goals, and how effective do you think the game is in advancing those goals?

  I think the game is sweet. However, it might be rather simplified, because usually people move out of areas not because of diversity but because of wealth. It actually goes to show that wealth is just as important as a factor as race or other ways of segregation.

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Great discussion was had

### Gear Up
#### Basic Income

How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?

 - Realities are that automation is unstoppable. How it will affect the economy is largely unknown in its entirety. However, most economists are predicting a large decrease in available jobs. Opportunities for normally skilled workers will be eliminated. Artificial intelligence will begin to take over even very advanced white collar jobs - ones that we could never compete with.

What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?

 - My reaction is that if the tech visionaries are saying it's inevitable, I believe them. They work the deepest into this field that will inevitably make jobs obsolete.

Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?

  - Automation is becoming increasingly more competent at doing jobs that normally highly skilled humans are doing now, which is predicted to lead to massive unemployment. Without jobs available, people won't be able to provide for themselves. Wealth will be increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few at the expense of the majority, causing civil unrest.

Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI?

  - Absolutely.

What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?

  - I think in order to be a responsibile citizen it's important to look at others who have been born into situations in which they cannot escape, and acknowledge the fact that you're lucky. Give back to hopefully balance out that luck.
