## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I wanted to acquire more experience with front end technologies, work on collaboration skills with front end developers, and refine my approach to interviews and interview questions.

## JS Assessment

No longer applicable as of 1804-BE

## Technical Communication Assessment

The Technical Communication Assessment was a valuable experience, where I was able to discuss OOP in a meaningful way, work through an enjoyable technical problem, and receive constructive, actionable feedback. I stumbled over my words a touch when discussing feature versus unit tests, but overall I enjoy the process of sitting down and talking about code. During technical challenges I typically like to restate the challenge, ask appropriate clarifying questions, and then start with the larger lattice work structure of the problem. If it's designing a parking lot, I'm probably going to start with the parking lot. Starting really broad and narrowing in on the issue generally means that I'm thinking appropriately about how this thing is used, rather than zooming in on individual parts immediately. Interviews are conversations, not interrogations. All I need to be successful is to be positive, accept feedback, and follow advice.

## Quantified Self

Quantified Self was a 3 week project, where the 1st week was to build a familiar rails API, then to translate that same API into the express framework with a partner, and finally to build a separate jQuery/JS frontend. It's always challenging to learn a new language, especially when it's far less opinionated than the more familiar Rails. Dealing with asynchronous operations and retrieving data using Knex was sometimes burdensome, but after the discovery of async functions the project became for more manageable. I particularly enjoyed working with the external recipe API and jQuery to build a truly unique recipe generating experience. It was a phenomenal way to learn DOM manipulation. I wish I had a little more time to experiment with the front end, I was finally feeling comfortable on the penultimate day of the project, but we didn't have time to fully flesh out the front end my partner and I had imagined. However, struggling with a partner made the arduous task of learning a new language, a new framework, and a new asynchronous paradigm palatable (dare I say, even fun)?

## Capstone Project

Our capstone project was a simple app built to find blooming flowers in parks and trails around Jefferson County. On the backend, we were tasked with creating a database with this information. Unfortunately, there's not an easily accessible API or database with specific blooming information and locations on flowers. However, the CSU extension plant database had most of the information we were looking for - but we had to scrape and validate the data. This was a new and intriguing challenge for my partner and I. We were able to build a micro service that scraped the data and sent the valid JSON objects to our main app so we could generate a CSV with the appropriate information to seed our database. Seeing those CSVs with valid data being inserted into our database was a phenomenal feeling! We even had time to explore redis, sideKiq, background workers, new relic, and swagger documentation. All the things from MOD 2 and MOD 3 we hadn't had an opportunity to fully explore up until now.

## Open Source Project

We did not do an Open Source Project this mod. However, we did put in a PR on another cohort mates project. I worked on Dress the Child and designed a new navbar for them! It was actually quite rewarding, and more fun than it had any right to be.

## Feedback

I had an interesting mod. I was drained, had some sickness in my family that was weighing on my mind, and I was not as nice to others as I had been in previous mods. My negativity was pointed out, not in a harsh light, but in a realistic, pragmatic way, which I appreciate. It was actually a relief to let go of some of the stress and negative feelings that I had bundled up. So I apologized, and moved on. Post that discussion, things have been much calmer, and I feel a lot less internal turmoil.

## Gear Up

In a previous life, I ran staff trainings at the central library in Denver on Setting Healthy Boundaries, so I was very happy to see that such a good group of people had decided to work on the gear-up as well. Luckily, I had a slide show prepared that required only minor adjustments to be appropriate and fit in the context of Turing. I always enjoy facilitating, it's a huge part of who I am, and this was no exception. However, gear-up is during a challenging time at Turing. Week 5 is mentally exhausting, and I think many people feel vulnerable and sensitive. That's not a bad thing when discussing boundaries, but there can be reactions that range from negative to apathetic. And that's OK. It's OK for people to feel how they feel. It's especially rewarding when people are willing to share those feelings in a direct and honest way during a gear-up session.

## Community Involvement

With what time I did have I tried to assist mod 1 and 2 with the issues that I could help with (I had the opportunity to pair a few times with some wonderful people). I was an active participant in the PD sessions, using my previous experience as a resume/cover letter coach to assist others.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

I'm a strong technical writer and communicator. I'm a ravenous learner with a strong desire to experience new paradigms and patterns in code. And I'm honest when I have a question or don't know something.
