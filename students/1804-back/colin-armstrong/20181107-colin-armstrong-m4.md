# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What did you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

_I wanted to focus on getting better with JavaScript and working on my overall process.  I wanted to get better with my Agile practices, git workflow, and communication with teammates._  


## Technical Communication Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

__PASS__

* What was your biggest challenge?

	_My biggest challenge during the technical interview was responding to questions I was unsure of.  I felt like I started stumbling over words when I was unsure of myself and I need to work on being more confident discussing topics I am unfamiliar with._


* What did you like the most about the challenge?

	_I enjoyed discussing my knowledge and opinions related to software development.  I felt like I answered most questions pretty well which gives me confidence going into actual interviews._

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

	_My approach to solving the challenge was to start talking about topics I did know about and try to relate it back to the topic I was unsure of._

* What did you learn?

	_I learned more about how to deal with interview questions I am unsure of, how to better explain my thought process during whiteboarding exercises, and how to feel more comfortable in a technical  interview setting._


## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

	_My biggest technical challenge was learning to use JavaScript to do the things I wanted it to do.  Getting used to a new ORM (Knex) was also a challenge because I was so used to ActiveRecord._

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

	_My approach to solving the JavaScript challenges was mostly trial and error with some research.  Figuring out Knex required reading a lot of documentation._

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

	_Learning JavaScript is actually starting to become really fun and rewarding.  I really enjoy all the different ways it can be used to manipulate webpages and make them dynamic._

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

	_Building a server with Express/Knex, utilizing fetch requests in JavaScript, and using NPM._

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

	_If I could change one thing about my technical approach, it would be to focus more heavily on the backend portion of the project before doing so much with the frontend._

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

	_Working with a partner while learning something new is both rewarding and challenging.  It is challenging because often times, neither one of us would have the answer.  But it was also rewarding in that we were able to help each other out along the way._

## Cross-Pollination Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

	_The biggest technical challenge on this project was setting up Devise JWT for authentication using JSON Web Tokens.  It was a new technology that none of the group members had much experience working with and was challenging to setup._

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

	_Our approach ended up being doing a lot of research, reading a lot of blogs, and watching a view tutorial videos to finally get authentication working as we intended._

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

	_It was rewarding when we finally got it working.  I was also able to help a fellow student get similar authentication working for their project which felt good._

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

	_JSON Web Tokens for authentication, Nightmare for web scraping, and some React/Redux._


## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

_The most meaningful piece of feedback came during a PD session regarding how to approach the job search.  The feedback was to being thinking of yourself as someone who is a valuable asset for perspective employers.  This shift in mindset has made me more confident in the job search and helped me write better cover letters and better market myself._

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

_Overall, the Gear Up session seemed to get lost in everything else going on this mod.  It's hard to focus on something like this with classwork and the job hunt always on your mind.  It ended up being something that was kind of thrown together the night before but overall it went alright.  The feedback we received was positive overall and I think there were some students in the session who really got something out of it.  I wouldn't say I enjoyed the experience and the end result left me feeling slightly disappointed overall but happy that it was over.  The most rewarding part of it was seeing everyone in the group come together at the last second to pull it off._

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

_I felt I was able to provide help and guidance to  a lot of people in the cohort.  I enjoy helping others work through blockers in their projects and helping the debugging process.  I also feel like I was able to keep a level head and keep everyone together in a sense when some stressful events occurred.  There was a time when the overall energy of the mod became very negative but luckily that turned around and hopefully I was part of the reason why._

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

* _The ability to learn new skills quickly_
* _The willingness and grit to persevere during stressful times_
* _The desire to grow as both a developer and a person_

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md)
