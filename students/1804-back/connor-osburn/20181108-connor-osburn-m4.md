### Biggest Challenges
I think one of the biggest challenges this mod was team work. Team work was a little simpler with projects that had explicit
directions. We could divide specific instructions and work very effectively. However, those were pre baked projects. It makes
it a lot harder when you are working on something that doesn't exist yet. I had to work on teams using brand new technologies, 
and things that maybe one person in the partnership might not be as solid on.

### Biggest Achievement
I think creating a single page app with Django/Javascript was the most impressive thing I did in mod 4. Most of the front end instruction
in the back end program has involved loading static pages. And with the addition of Javascript, we still hadn't gotten into all of 
the techniques nessecary to create a single page app. It also felt good to do that without leaning on a framework.

### New frontend perspectives
I think picking up this part of the stack has been wildly beneficial. In rails monoliths, we often see front end pages as 
static and generated at the time of the server request. It is great to think of it as a living, breathing application.

### Takeaways for work
I think the biggest takeaways are going to be the dynamics of working with others. I had done quite a bit of programming prior,
but alone in my room. And these team work lessons are not just inter-personal. They are technical. Writing code so that
your team can use it, and reading code that you didn't write (and even code you think might not be perfect), to make a cohesive app.

### Gear ups
I think the gear up I took away the most from was the micro-agressions gear up. It is eye opening to put yourself in the position
of someone who experiences the world differently and examining for blind spots. There are things that hurt me that other people
might not know about. But for some reason, I couldn't see outside of myself to understand that other people have the exact same
phenomena, and many of them are commonly used against entire groups that are all aware of this form of agression that
some might not even believe exists when told about. That is the real danger of blind spots.
