# Stephen Malek - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
From the beginning of the module I wanted to make sure that I had a strong grasp on all of the concepts that were taught. I wanted to complete every project and do well on every paired and individual assessment. I feel that I do have a strong grasp on the ruby language now. The very first practice assessment I did not complete the final iteration correctly and I made a goal that I would get better and faster so that I could complete the rest of them. I spent more time doing practice exercises and doing the projects to help me feel more comfortable on the timed assessments. I even did practice timed assessments and timed myself to see what was taking me the longest to do. I accomplished my goal and was able to finish all of the rest of the individual timed assessments and even give myself time to refactor on some. In order to meet my goal for finishing and improving all of my projects I spent more time on them and front loaded the projects so I could get them done earlier and have time to refactor. Time spent refactoring helped me notice bad tendencies that I had in my code and helped me to start writing things correctly the first time. The feedback from the project evaluations also helped me to see things that I needed to change on future projects. Everything that we have done this mod has helped me to grow as a developer and I now feel confident that I can meet the challenges ahead.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I feel I have passed the the end of module assessment. I was able to get through the last iteration an hour early which gave me time to go back and refactor to make sure I was using the correct enumberables in the right situations. I was able to effectively break up the difficult problems into smaller methods to help solve the big problem. I went over and made sure I was testing everything that was specified in the spec. I was able to make different classes work together effectively. My code worked correctly and it was fairly concise. I went through and made sure my methods were 5 lines and no more than 80 characters wide. Overall, I feel I did very well on the end of module assessment. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I have completed during Module 1 are Mastermind, Date Night, and Battleship.

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sdmalek44/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

Mastermind was my first project at turing. The goal was to create a game with ruby code that you can play in the terminal. My version of mastermind allows you to choose a difficulty and depending on that difficulty sets a random sequence of different colored elements. The game will prompt the user to enter a guess of what they think the elements are and in what order. If incorrect the game will tell you how many of the correct element you have guessed and how many are in the correct position. You keep guessing until you get the correct sequence. When you guess the sequence correctly it will prompt you that you won, how many guesses you made and how long it took you. 

Evaluation Comments:
* time array in text class is a great place for a hash
* Don't put data type in variable name
* Rename Text class to something about user input
* If you are nesting, probably a good sign for a refactor
* You should break your runner file into methods
* Variable names aren't idomatic
* Generating the answer based on difficulty could be it's own method
  * This would ensure dynamic functionality
* Can use optional params instead of accessors to make testing possible
