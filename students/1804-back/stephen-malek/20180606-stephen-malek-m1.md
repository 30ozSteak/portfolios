# Stephen Malek - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
From the beginning of the module I wanted to make sure that I had a strong grasp on all of the concepts that were taught. I wanted to complete every project and do well on every paired and individual assessment. I feel that I do have a strong grasp on the ruby language now. The very first practice assessment I did not complete the final iteration correctly and I made a goal that I would get better and faster so that I could complete the rest of them. I spent more time doing practice exercises and doing the projects to help me feel more comfortable on the timed assessments. I even did practice timed assessments and timed myself to see what was taking me the longest to do. I accomplished my goal and was able to finish all of the rest of the individual timed assessments and even give myself time to refactor on some. In order to meet my goal for finishing and improving all of my projects I spent more time on them and front loaded the projects so I could get them done earlier and have time to refactor. Time spent refactoring helped me notice bad tendencies that I had in my code and helped me to start writing things correctly the first time. The feedback from the project evaluations also helped me to see things that I needed to change on future projects. Everything that we have done this mod has helped me to grow as a developer and I now feel confident that I can meet the challenges ahead.
