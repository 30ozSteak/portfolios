* What was your biggest achievement of the module?
    - Building Quantified Self which consisted of a backend api in node.js/express and a frontend Javasript/jQuery app that communicate with each other.  The first time I had used JavaScript was over the intermission so to be able to build both the frontend and backend of a web app with JavaScript was a huge accomplishment.  I was able to picture how the app would be designed in Rails and then with what we had learned in lecture, apply that to create the routes and fetch calls.  It was harder to draw parallels between front end rails(erb) and front end JavaScript/jQuery but there were many resources online that were able to help me. 

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
    - Working with the front end students on the cross pollination project.  We had to change our initial app idea because of change in team members and incompatible api data. Additionally, the whole the dynamic was different as opposed to working with all backenders.  We had to remedy CORS issues, decide which end should handle what and come up with a cohesive vision for the app.  I learned that I needed to explain backend/ruby/rails terms in a way that someone who is unfamiliar with those technologies can understand.  My knowledge of JavaScript allowed me to do such.

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
    - I have reached out and made many connections with people who are employed in the technology field.  I was a little hesitant at first to go on coffee meetings, phone calls, emails but after I did these things a couple times I saw the benefit that they provide.  I have gotten more contacts from the people that I initially met through cold outreach so my network is growing quickly which will help me in my job search efforts.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) 
impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
    -  I enjoyed working with front-end technologies very much so.  It made me appreciate the different complexities that are present when building the frontend of applications.  I like focusing at one at a time as opposed to doing both because it allows me to fully dive into that part and not have to reframe my mind which ruins the flow of my work.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
    - Work hard, be passionate and enthusiastic, take breaks when you need to, teamwork makes the dream work, ask good questions, seek help when stuck, listen to others, always be learning, try new things, go outside of your comfort zone.

* What was your biggest takeaway from Gear Ups while at Turing? How has that impacted you and how will it impact you and your co-workers when you are on the job?
    - Everyone has a different experience in life and in the workplace.  Listen, be respectful, empathetic and help/advocate whenever you can.
