## John Roemer Mod4 Portfolio

   During module 4 we learned about the language of the web, Javascript. I feel that my biggest accomplishment during this time was working on 3 projects that all used Jacascript to present data from a separate back end api. I enjoy learning about how multiple systems can link together to create more dynamic experiences for users. 

   The most challenging part of module 4 for me was continuing to support my cohort mates when they needed help with projects and debugging even when I was feeling very burnt out and stressed. It was challenging to be a constructive part of a team with the energy level I found in myself during module 4.  

   Similar to what I started exploring in module 3, I experimented with the structure of Rails APIs. Although I do not feel like I’ve exhausted this exercise, I feel that my practice of questioning the way we do things has led me to have a strong understanding of how to take advantage of the characteristics of OOP. Especially single responsibility principle. SRP is something we learned about very early in module 1 but it wasn’t until recently that I was able to put that principle to work. 

   Now that I have more experience working on ‘full stack’ projects, I feel much more comfortable pursuing jobs that may require me to jump back and forth from back end to front end. I am also excited to continue learning more about Javascript in my future career. 

   The most important skill from Turing I will bring to my next job is what I’ve learned about test driven development in the context of agile workflows. Learning how to take a user story from inception, to failing test then to implemented code. I feel that being able to follow this pattern will make me a contributing member of any engineering team. 

   The most important thing I learned from Gear Ups at Turing was how to listen first and accept everyone’s point of view as truth. I learned that I should never assume that others share the same perspective I do. Understanding these two things has helped me have more positive outcomes from sensitive conversations with others that have differing opinions.
