Angela Duran Mod 4 Portfolio
What was your biggest achievement of the module?
My biggest achievement was getting all the project work done and still finding time to do anything job related. The mod started off sort of calm and I thought there was going to be more time for job stuff but there just wasn't a whole lot.

What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
In the last project (solo) I ran into problems with deployment. I spent two days working on it and was ultimately unsuccessful. I learned a lot though: lots about webpacker, rails asset pipeline, heroku error logs, etc. Most importantly, though, I think I should have at some point just admitted defeat and started the project over.

What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
I think the thing that possibly sets me apart from my peers is that I took on some small sort of leadership role in my groups this mod. In both the cross-polination and the Gear Up group I found myself setting up meetings, making sure people remembered stuff, etc. Especially in the Gear Up group - I ended up making basically the entire lesson plan and everyone just went with it.

How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
The cross pollination project opened my eyes to what's possible with front end technologies. Before that I was pretty proud of myself, doing my vanilla javascript and my jquery, with my express server or whatever. When I saw what the frontenders had done with their setup I was truly blown away and now I definitely want to learn more about it. My plan is to learn React once school is over, and be open to doing more front end stuff in a job.

What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
The most important skill I'll take from Turing is the ability to learn a new thing on my own thoroughly enough to make it work in the real world. I'm grateful for the development of the real skill of looking up information to solve problems. I realize it didn't work so well on my last project but it served me well most of the time before that, and I look forward to using it in the future.

What was your biggest takeaway from Gear Ups while at Turing? How has that impacted you and how will it impact you and your co-workers when you are on the job?
My biggest takeaway from Gear Ups is that I need to be more aware of the underrepresentation of women and minorities in tech, and I need to be ready to stand up for myself and/or my coworkers.
