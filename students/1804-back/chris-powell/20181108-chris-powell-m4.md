# BE MOD4 Portfolio

# Module Overview

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?

   Teaching myself Python and solving some pretty interesting problems it provided
   for me.

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

   Creating a full stack application with JS. I learned that it is possible to do such
   a thing but I also feel like it is a little ridiculous. I didn't really learn how
   to do anything new, I just learned how to do the same 'ol stuff in a different way.

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

   I taught myself Python and created an api with flask.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

   I think what I learned most from mod4 is that Rails is a dying framework and
   there are not many jobs left that utilize it. That aside there are plenty utilizing
   JS and it's not always for front end. I don't necessarily want to work in either
   but JS it seem is pretty much unavoidable.
   I also learned taht I am now a bit off put by Rails for the extreme amount of 'magic' it uses to hide giant
   collections of source code. It was a great framework to learn on but I
   learned that I like other frameworks where you have to include the packages/libraries as you
   need them.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

   In the past couple of weeks I learned that I have a somewhat intuitional understanding of where
   some really challenging errors are coming from, especially in the deployment environment. I have
   also surprised myself in being able implement from documentation unfamiliar technologies. Even at
   the beginning of the mod4 that was still a challenge.

* What was your biggest takeaway from Gear Ups while at Turing? How has that impacted you and how will it impact you and your co-workers when you are on the job?

   The Gear Up that stuck with me the most was the micro aggression Gear up. Even know I
   recognize, in myself and other people, subtle and insensitive things that are remarked
   upon that can be offense to other people. I want to abolish these insensitivities in
   myself and stand up for those they hurt.


## Quantified Self

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS*PASS

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

   The biggest technical challenge for me was the quantified self full stack assignment.
   It was divided and conquered by me and my partner and we had differing ideas on how
   things should have been done, a lot of time was consumed by debating about our approaches.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

   I liked the 'magic' of being able to make the page very interactive with out having
   to make the page refresh. I liked using fetch calls to retrieve data without having to
   refresh also.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

   We solved the challenge by explaining our ideas thoroughly to each other until
   we both came to a mutual understanding on each problem.

* What did you learn?

   I learned how to create apis with JS which I honestly hope I never have to do again.
   I think it is a great language for front end applications but right now I don't understand
   why it needs to be used for backend applications when there are so many other languages
   for that.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

   Learning how to create and API with Python. As I mentioned above, Rails gives
   it all to you right out of the box. This is not so with Python and even after
   your done creating functionalities in your development environment when you
   deploy, at least to Heroku, there are extra configurations you need to set up
   on their servers to make the thing work.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

   I solved this challenge by reflecting upon how I had to set things up in development.
   Rails connects you to your database and creates it for you with one cli command.
   In Python you have to create the database yourself through the shell and then
   configure your application to connect to it and then it's basically the same after
   you deploy. Heroku is set up to create a Rails app with a couple of cli commands
   but it was not the same with the flask app. I was able to overcome this difficulty
   by imagining that the Heroku server was basically a machine that behaved as my own
   laptop and I was surprised to find this was mostly true. Knowing that I had Python
   code on Heroku I followed the same config steps and it worked.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

   I liked solving problems that I thought were to complicated for me to understand.
   It felt extremely empowering to do that.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

   1. The extreme importance of environmental variables on the server side.
   2. That databases are unique entities, not just something a framework creates for you.
   3. Exiting a session doesn't destroy a cookie, In short browser caching can create unforseen
   problems.
