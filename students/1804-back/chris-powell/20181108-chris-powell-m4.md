# BE MOD4 Portfolio

# Module Overview

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?

   Teaching myself Python and solving some pretty interesting problems it provided
   for me.

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

   Creating a full stack application with JS. I learned that it is possible to do such
   a thing but I also felt like the project was really rushed and so I didn't retain
   a lot of what I created. I understand I might have to get a job using this approach
   in the future and so it was nice having the exposure.

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

   I taught myself Python and created an API with flask.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

   I learned that the user experience starts with the frontend and creating interactive
   webpages is really an artform. I think I still would like to work in backend but if I
   could find a job where I would be influential in designing front end interactions that
   would be pretty alright with me too.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

   In the past couple of weeks I learned that I have a somewhat intuitional understanding of where
   some really challenging errors are coming from, especially in the deployment environment. I have
   also surprised myself in being able implement from documentation unfamiliar technologies. Even at
   the beginning of mod4 that was still a challenge.

* What was your biggest takeaway from Gear Ups while at Turing? How has that impacted you and how will it impact you and your co-workers when you are on the job?

   The Gear Up that stuck with me the most was the micro aggression Gear up. Even know I
   recognize, in myself and other people, subtle and insensitive things that are remarked
   upon that can be offense to other people. I want to abolish these insensitivities in
   myself and stand up for those they hurt.


## Quantified Self

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

   The biggest technical challenge for me was dividing the work with my partner.
   We had differing ideas on how things should have been done and so
   a lot of time was consumed by debating our opinions. Although this isn't a
   technical aspect of the project many of the conversations we had were
   technical.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

   I liked the 'magic' of being able to make the page very interactive without having
   to make the page refresh. I liked using fetch calls to retrieve data without having to
   refresh also. I love JS for these things.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

   We solved the challenge by explaining our ideas thoroughly to each other until
   we both came to a mutual understanding on each problem.

* What did you learn?

   I learned how to create an API with JS. Given more time I probably
   would have been able to create a really good API or at least a
   better one. JS is a difficult language when it is used for backend
   applications but I can be done with a little wrangling.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

   Learning how to create an API with Python. Rails give it all to you right out of the box.
   This is not so with Python and even after your done creating functionalities in your d
   evelopment environment when you deploy, at least to Heroku, there are extra configurations
   you need to set up on their servers to make the thing work.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

   I solved this challenge by reflecting upon how I had to set things up in development.
   Rails connects you to your database and creates it for you with one cli command.
   In Python you have to create the database yourself and then
   configure your application to connect to it and then it's basically the same after
   you deploy. Heroku is set up to create a Rails app with a couple of cli commands
   but it was not the same with the flask app. I was able to overcome this difficulty
   by imagining that the Heroku server was basically a machine that behaved as my own
   laptop and I was surprised to find this was mostly true. Knowing that I had Python
   code on Heroku I followed the same config steps and it worked.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

   I liked solving problems that I thought were to complicated for me to understand.
   It felt extremely empowering to do that.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

   1. The extreme importance of environmental variables on the server side.
   2. That databases are unique entities, not just something a framework creates for you.
   3. Exiting a session doesn't destroy a cookie, In short browser caching can create unforseen
   problems.
