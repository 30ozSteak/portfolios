# JP Lynch - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module 1 I wanted to create a good base to build upon during the remainder of my time here at Turing.  I identified a couple areas that I knew I needed to improve upon during my time in Mod1, these areas being testing and readability.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I feel I progressed through the projects here in Mod1. In the first project (mastermind) I first created it without any classes, and then had to adapt the code for classes.  By Black Thursday, we were planning out classes and modules before we ever began.

#### (mastermind)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JPLynch35/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/mastermind)

This project creates a REPL playable version of the game mastermind.  The user tries to guess the computer generated code (by guessing colors in each position).  The game ends when the player correctly guesses the computer generated code.

Too may attr_readers  
Too much in initialize  
Don't need to rename variables for Text.new  
Need to work on your naming of variables and methods  
if you're checking for 0 or 1 as flags, you should use a boolean  
Try to use less flags  
Runners needs to be refactored for readability  
Do this by making abstract, high level methods  
attr_readers should each be on a new line

#### (sortingcards)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JPLynch35/SortingCards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/sorting_cards)

This project utilizes nested classes which can access other classes to gain information.  It starts with a card, then builds a deck, then creates a round.  The round is required to access the deck class, the card class, and also a guess class.

overall pretty good  
clean  
card class does not follow spec in regards to value  
record_guess does not return guess object  
pretty thorough testing

#### (engima)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MLuce/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

This project was the first introduction to working with a partner on GitHub. The project utilized a rotating cipher (based on a random generated key and the current date) and encrypted a message.  The program then had to decrypt the message given the key and the date encrypted.  In addition, the program required a 'crack' method that would crack the encryption utilizing the knowledge that every message ended with '..end..'
