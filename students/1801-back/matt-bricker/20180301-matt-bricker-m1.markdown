###### Feedback to Me
Hey Matt! Thanks for all your hard work during the project! You were willing to come in on the weekends and stay late after school each day to work and that was awesome! Our driver/navigator sessions were always productive and our problem solving helped us get over each of the humps. Going forward, be willing to try different solutions and try attacking a problem from different angles with the idea that code is cheap and you can always delete it if it doesn't work. Thanks again for all your hard work and patience throughout the project!
