## D: Professional Skills
Primarily, I feel like I understand how I work within a development team more fully.
How my skills and personality fit within a greater whole and how I can leverage those
for a more successful team overall.

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)

This session on stress management was extremely helpful. It hammered home the growth mindset along
with how to take care of ourselves. I enjoyed this and have continued thinking about these tips and
trying to actively perform them.

### Gear Up
#### (Working Styles)

This session was about introverts, extroverts, and ambiverts. I found it interesting how different the
learning styles between them were and how to work with people who fell along the spectrum. It also helps
knowing how I'm most comfortable working with people and to communicate that in DTR's;.

### Gear Up
#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

The video and article at the beginning of this video were very insightful. We then talked to different
people on how we could implement these at Turing and that helped hammer home some actionable tips. Turing
is incredibly difficult and to see how other people have talked learning a difficult subject was a great
learning experience.

### Gear Up
#### (Learning Through Teaching)

The Mod 4 students were really insightful in how the techniques of teaching and being a student transfer
over to being a mentor and mentee. I've struggled with this and hearing different techniques is extremely
helpful.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

How do you contribute?:
