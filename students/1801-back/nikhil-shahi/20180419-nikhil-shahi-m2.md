# Nikhil Shahi - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to continue the learning momentum that I had established while repeating mod 1. At the same time, I wanted to reach out and help new students in mod 1 as I knew exactly what they were going through. I feel I was successful in achieving both these objectives. Mod 2 has been very interesting for me as the concepts were not difficult to grasp - but it was a lot of stuff to remember and practice. The static comp challenges were a lot of fun and have definitely stoked my interest in getting good at FE. At the same time, I feel that the Friday challenges were really good to build muscle memory and understand DB relationships like many-to-many. I actually wish we had  a couple of such one hour challenges on a weekly basis (I know it might be overkill, but I would have loved to have some more). All in all, it was a very interesting mod, with lots of new concepts. In mod 1, I used to wonder how all that logic we were learning would translate to building stand alone apps and then four weeks into mod 1, we were building our own apps like job tracker and idea box. It was very fulfilling.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass


## B: Individual Work & Projects

In mod 2, we had IdeaBox as our individual project.

#### IdeaBox

* https://github.com/Shniks/ideabox
* http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project

This purpose of this project is to create an app that lets users record their ideas.

Evaluation comments: This project was not assessed. This was the one project that really drove home some concepts for me, especially pertaining to authorization and authentication. With the help of Ian and Ali, I was able to complete the project while conforming to all the specs that were laid out for us. I also enjoyed having the freedom to work with css and design the site the way I wanted to.

Evaluation scores: N/A

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This mod we had the following group projects:

a) Little Shop Redux  
b) Job Tracker  
c) Bike Share

#### Little Shop Redux

* https://github.com/Shniks/little-shop-redux
* https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux

In this project we used Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that shows items by categories and analyzes those items.

Evaluation comments:

- CRUD Merchants Merchant Dashboard  
- CRUD Items Items Dashboard  
- RUD Invoices Invoices Dashboard  
- Some edge case testing Some duplication of data prep Missing a couple of model level tests  
- Using Ruby to solve some AR problems on Merchant  
- Using two db calls where one would do

#### Job Tracker

* https://github.com/Shniks/job-tracker
* https://github.com/turingschool/job-tracker

In this project we worked with the existing code in a repo, to modify a personal job tracking app.

Evaluation comments:

- Job create comment button doesn't link

#### Bike Share

* https://github.com/lilwillifo/bikeshare

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Empathy and Privilege  

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod2_Week1_Empathy_and_Privilege.markdown

I really liked this session as it exposed me to how people in our society might experience marginalization or privilege based on their background or other attributes. It made my peers and I aware that we need to develop empathy with respect to privilege, which will help us in interacting with others and make a positive difference in their lives.

#### Group Think  

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/groupthink.md

This was a very interesting class that defined what groupthink is (essentially a phenomenon where people strive for consensus within a group). We learnt to identify its symptoms, its pros and cons, and also learnt how to avoid its many pitfalls.

#### Finding Meaningful Common Ground  

* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xVlmU6mXCUMJGy0qcjRufEusr9ktbtRWO72K8nkewNY/edit#gid=393922023

I enjoyed this session led by the mod 4 students. We learnt how to interact with others in a social or networking environment and to understand how to start a conversation with a complete stranger.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

One of the great things about Turing has been the plethora of teachers, mentors and peers that have been so willing to help me out with my understanding of the subject matter. Wanting to pay it forward and continuing my tradition from mod 1, I spent a substantial amount of my time mentoring mod 1 students and helping them with their issues. I paired with 3 to 5 students in all and spent between 6 to 8 hours a week with them, either pairing with them on project work or helping them prepare for their paired assessments. Realizing that some students were nervous about their final paired assessment, I took initiative to arrange for pairings between mod 1 students and my peers in mod 2, to simulate a final paired assessment. I look forward to continuing this tradition with the incoming mod 1 BE class.
