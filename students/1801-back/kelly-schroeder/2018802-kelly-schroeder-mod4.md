### 1801 Mod 4 Portfolio

**What was your biggest achievement of the module?**  
For me the biggest achievement was definitely the capstone. To have, in essentially 1 week, created a functioning app in a relatively new language and framework felt great. In addition to the Django/Python practice I was able to experiment and implement quite a bit a JavaScript and jQuery. It was very satisfying to create something that matched the vision I started with, and that my friends are are actually using. And while I had to rush a few parts and ended up with some less than optimal code in a few parts, I feel proud of how I used the project to hone some of my non-technical skill such as time-boxing, version control and project planning. On top of all of that this is the first project I actually know that I will continue to work on moving forward. I have a solid road map for more iterations and features, and I look forward to building Adventure day into exactly what I want it to be.


**What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?**  



**What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?**  



**How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?**  




**What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?**
