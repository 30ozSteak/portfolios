Areas of emphasis

Having no experience of coding before coming to turing and and being assigned to a
project within a week was really hard for me so i didnt do so well. I now, realize learning to code requires way more hard work and practice than i was doing. since im repeating mod1, i will be working really  hard to achieve my goal.
