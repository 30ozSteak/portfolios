## A: End of Module Assessment

PASS

# Evaluation Criteria
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
## 1. Ruby Style
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
## 2. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
## 3. Testing
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.
## 4. Progression/Completion
4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
## 5. Workflow
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

 Individual work/projects consisted of APICurious and the Self-Directed Project. I enjoyed both of them and learned a hell of a lot completing both of them. API Curious was a great but onerous intro to consuming APIs and the s-d project was a great process of bringing an idea to fruition as well as learning JS fundamentals!

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/APICurious)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

 API Curious is a primer in consuming apis and oauth. We set out to clone basic functionality of a personal github home page. I'm particularly proud of my work here, it was great to be able to create some real functionality on my own and I pushed to make a post request work!
