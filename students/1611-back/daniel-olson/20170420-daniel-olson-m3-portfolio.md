-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

# Evaluation Criteria
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
## 1. Ruby Style
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
## 2. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
## 3. Testing
2: Developer writes tests. Most new lines of code are tested but they aren’t effective at testing for functionality and value.
NOTE: 5 test, 3 passing - feature & request
## 4. Progression/Completion
3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
NOTE: Printing 16 stores instead of 10
NOTE: Hard coded in the zip, had a zipcode passed in but didn't use it so probably just an oversight in the end.
## 5. Workflow
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### APICurious

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Rails Engine

* https://github.com/blackknight75/rails-engine
* http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine

n this project, you will use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

# Evaluation

(feedback to me)

#### Cloney Isaland

* https://github.com/TheKaterTot/cloney_island (main app)
* https://github.com/TheKaterTot/cloney_island_companion (companion app)
* http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island

In this project, we built a new platform from scratch to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users & admins).

##  Evaluation

Each group is required to do a self assessment using the rubric below and bring it to your evaluation.

You'll be graded on each of the criteria below with a score of (1) well below
expectations, (2) below expectations, (3) as expected, (4) better than expected.

### Completion

**Client Expectations**

*   Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
    *   4: Better than expected

**User Experience**

*   Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
    *   3: As expected

**Organization**

*   Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
    *   3: As expected

### Technical Evaluation

**Git Workflow**

*   Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.
    *   4: Better than expected

**Test Quality**

*   Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?
    *   4: Better than expected

**Code Quality**

*   Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.
    *   3: As expected

**Bonus**

We want to recognize and reward risk-taking and exploration. Sometimes other areas might suffer if the risk doesn't pan out. Earn a bonus point to offset a score above.

*   Did the team push themselves by taking risks?
    *   1: Yes
