Casey and I worked well together, and we were both able to spend a lot of time getting to know JS better.

Specification Adherence


3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect
Good work with functionality. I don't see many bugs, but I also don't see an extension. If I'm wrong, please let me know!

Planning and Design

3: Team created either a schema or API docs to facilitate implementation of a service.
Good work with the API documentation for the backend. I don't see a schema anywhere, but I know y'all talked through what you wanted your schema to look like

Testing


3: All back-end functionality is covered by tests. Front-end uses unit tests wherever logic can be separated from interface and network requests.
You have robust test coverage for your backend, which is awesome! I only see a WIP for the frontend tests, but I like the fact that you attempted frontend integration tests (even though you didn't quite get it to work).

HTML/UI

4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.
Your UI looks great. Everything appears to be well-organized and structured.

JS syntax and Style

3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.
You kept OO in mind when organizing your code base and consistently used ES6 and good naming conventions. There is room for improvement here with keeping functions single responsibility, but I think you both are off to a great start.

Git Workflow

4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation
You utilized git well and created branches, PR's, and engaged in meaningful discussion on your PR's. Keep this up!

Project Management

3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.

#### Capstone -- Will Legislate For Money

* https://github.com/meyerhoferc/will-legislate-for-money
* Add features to Courtney's existing Python/Django app.

I learned some Python!

1. Project Management

  4: Tracker also documents feature related discussions

2. Completion & Pace

  4: Team is proactive in understanding scope and is able to commit to stories before starting the sprint

3. Implementation Quality

  3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.

4. Application of Techniques

  4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.

5. Documentation

  4: Project also features a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor

6. Accessibility

  4: Team has expertly implemented features to follow accessibility best practices.


### Gear Up
#### Lending Privilege

* [GitHub URL]()

I really like facilitating a Gear-Up. I felt that because students were able to choose their sessions, they were more engaged
and willing to participate. I think our session led to some valuable conversations about how to recognize privilege and also
how to use it to someone else's advantage.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I led a few spikes this inning, one to answer questions from Mod1 students about arrays/hashes, and one over git workflow.
