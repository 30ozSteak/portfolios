While I understand the importance of this I had this work drilled into me during university and have almost 15 years experience of working with resumes and public representation of my person so feel very comfortable in this space.

### Learning to Pair

Driver - navigator nice in person making sure that who knows more is navigator and hopefully imparting that knowledge to the driver --- Ping pong helpful, I believe, for more evenly matched skill sets --- Screenhero really good for me cuz i'm super detailed oriented in describing where stuff is and describing what exactly is going on

### Feedback

This was good, helping me to learn HOW to frame the constructive portion of the feedback.  I've got a lot of intuition in this area with having coached people for 10+ years and figuring out how best to approach each person and make them feel very important while still providing something that improves them and drives them forward.

You dove right into this so fast.  Right after the initial DTR you had code blocks/files set up and ideas down on paper.  Going forward I’d think more DTRs that aren’t centered around simply work styles and life styles, but also the project itself would really help us with setting deliverable check points and advancing the whole of the project.  Specifics… this is hard… at this point it would seem the material we are facing is far more the inhibitor to our progress than any way that you or I work.  It’s tough to make specific recommendations to your work style when all the barriers that might force them are because of our grasp of the content (this comment applies to me too).  If anything be open about the content you/we don’t know.  Again that circles back to just knowing the material in the first place.  Relative to what I heard from other groups, on the personal level, we were amiable to each other, both had buy in on the effort and did our best to get the core of the project finished.

Dan was a rock for me. We'd gone thru Try Turing together and so had a connection early on.  He's been incredibly giving and volunteered both his time to help me understand the material in class as well as allowed me to vent my frustrations. His patience in times of immense struggle and the guidance that he was able to impart left me better able to tackle the work.  He's well poised to further his development going into Mod 2.  I'm super stoked for him and look to him (and others) as examples of perseverance in the face of repeated hardships that can eventually bring forth great success.  


3 - for Amara
This is easy, Amara is the reason I was able to keep my emotional head (barely) above the water in the first 4 weeks.  She made sure to check on me and take stock of my health. The things I was doing for others Amara was doing for me.  Taking care of the human element in this mix of chaos that I was attempting to adapt to.  Beyond the emotional component she guided me thru the maze of syllabus material helping me see/find things that I had no idea about.  Amara is the embodiment of compassion :)

Mark, you epitomize hard work. One of my biggest concerns in collaborating with others is a lack of drive and the tendency to spit the bit when the going gets tough, but it was never an issue during our project. I couldn't match your tenacity but I aspired to emulate it by showing up early and staying late. You're an excellent problem solver -- I felt like a lot of the time you were doing all the work because you'd just start putting things together whenever we got stuck. You sped through setbacks with ease and were quick to present ideas for solutions to our problems. Your background in working with athletes proved beneficial as you kept a positive attitude and knew the right things to say at the right time like giving praise or words of encouragement when things got tough. With my lack of experience in collaborating with others I felt like I held you back at times and if you were given another partner capable of better collaboration I don't think you'd have trouble completing the project to spec. To further your growth I think you can work to get comfortable with Github so you and your collaborators can stay on the same page throughout a project and try to interpret the project spec literally so as to not miss any requisite details.

Mark was awesome to work with in this Mod. His ability to think about things on a higher level really helped elevate my understanding of things we talked about. He is contantly here every day pushing to be better. Sometimes he is a little to hard on himself becasue I feel he knows way more than he gives himself credit for. Im priveledged to call him my friend I i look forward to continually working with him in the future.

When I was feeling really defeated about Battleship you sat with me and Max and helped us put our dissapointment in perspective. It was so incredibly helpful for me to hear that, from an outsider's perspective, it seemed like I was doing well. The encouragement was invaluable, and helped me adjust my attitude. I felt so much better after that conversation. I know that you struggled a lot this mod and I think that your attitude will help you through the rest of your time here. Thanks for the support.

### Playing a Part

offered myself as an open and listening "friend" to those that want to talk thru things - i'm no psychologist but being a coach has trained me to be pretty close to one.  We talk thru things and i dont give answeres but I ask questions that help them solve what emotional elements they are stuck on.
observing different backgrounds and having that inspire me to push harder on social change
