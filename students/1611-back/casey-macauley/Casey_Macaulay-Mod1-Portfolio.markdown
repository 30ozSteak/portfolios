# (Casey Macaulay) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this module were to:
1) Get projects finished ahead of time (stay on top of time management).
2)Get to class on time every day.
3) Pass and achieve each of the learning goals.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 4
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification

#### 4. Workflow


* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

## B: Individual Work & Projects: Jungle Beats, Battleship

I really enjoyed working on Jungle Beats and Battleship, despite not finishing the latter.
I was able to learn a lot about how to approach projects at the beginning, not start until
you understand the full big picture, how to ask for help (asking the right questions is so important!)
and TDD/debugging techniques.

#### (Jungle Beats)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1611-b/jungle_beats/casey-macauley/jungle_beat.markdown)

In Jungle Beats I created a Linked List, a data structure commonly used by computer scientists, which holds data within individual nodes. Jungle Beats includes methods that enable you to append, prepend, and insert data into the list, remove the last node, and check to see if specific data is included within the list.Specifically, this Linked List will play back the sounds given to it as data that is stored within the nodes. I learned a ton about arrays, and how to create your own data structures using existing structures
within the ruby language.

- 20 tests all passing
- talked about writing tests for the exact assertions we expect from the spec
- talked about refactoring and use of instance variables.

## Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### (Battleship)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/battleship)

Notes:
- on the edge of working, had one bug that we sorted out, going to continue working on it
- well-tested on integration and unit level

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

### 4. REPL Interface

* 2: Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

## C: Group Work & Projects: Enigma, Headcount

### Projects

Group projects are where I struggled most. With everything being so new - coding,
ruby, classes, projects and deciphering the spec harness - working with a partner was another
element of newness which absolutely forced me to employ the growth mindset.

By the end of each of my projects I felt like I had learned so much, including how valuable
it is to have a second person to bounce ideas off of. Next mod I would still like to focus on
process and how to evolve mine to be better at working with another person.

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alfosco/enigma)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/enigma)

Enigma was a beast! Not having a "big picture" understanding of the project was really a
detriment in later iterations. Learned new hash methods, and about class object relationships.

Application does not run
some issues with edge cases and deeper testing
overall code was written well, just crashed
some opportunities to break out things into separate objects,
started to head in that direction, just didn't finish.

1. Overall Functionality

1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
4. Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

(feedback to me)
Casey,
    Working with you on Enigma was a very good experience and I feel like you helped me improve my problem solving skills and understanding of the material. Having a positive and humorous attitude made you easy to work with. When things would blow up you never got discouraged and we could even have a laugh about some of them. You set a good habit of finding and fixing bugs before moving on to the next problem, even if they didn't immediately break anything. You were also quick and willing to explain how any part of the project worked that you built without me. I like to be able to understand how everything works in the project and this enabled that understanding.
    Before starting the project read the instructions carefully! This goes for both of us. We did a good job of white-boarding to conceptualize a complex problem or class, but we should have done it to illustrate the framework of the entire project that is in sync with the instructions. A few times it was hard to follow you when talking about how some complex logic was working. When we then illustrated it in a notebook or on the whiteboard it was easier to follow. It didn't help of course that sometimes I was mentally drained. We both were willing to take a break from working on the project for things like dinner, it would be good though to set some mandatory break times away from the computer so we maintain the mental capacity to solve complex problems.
    We didn't complete the project but you clearly know what you are doing and I know we could have finished it if we had a little more time. It took Alan Turing and his team almost 6 months to crack Enigma, we almost did it in a week. I look forward to pairing with you on a future project as we progress through the modules.

#### (Headcount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

"A whopper of a project" indeed! Learned so incredibly much about hashes, nested hashes,
loading CSV data, and how to utilize a module.

(evaluation comments)

(evaluation scores)

Hey Casey, working with you has been an absolute pleasure. I'm very pleased with how things went. We meshed well and worked hard but still had some laughs. Your drive is incredible and infectious. Just, as was already made apparent this week, make sure you get enough sleep and take some breaks! I have learned a lot from you. You are a .merge master and your knowledge of hashes has been a great learning resource for me. Be proud of the work, I know I am. I think both of us made great strides in our learning and that would not have been possible without a great partner. Look forward to our next one together

## D: Professional Skills
These sessions were helpful for me to reflect on how I got here, and where I'd like to go.
"I am a software developer."

### Gear Up
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/tree/master/m1_citizenship

I. Growth Mindset 12/2
Coming from the education world, "growth mindset" is a definitely a current buzzword. First introduced to it in an elementary
school, it seemed like such a straight forward concept - putting it into action, however, is an entirely different story.

As a perfectionist, it is sometimes hard for me to accept that not everything is going to be exactly as it should be. From
what I've learned/seen about software development so far is that there isn't just one way to do things, and you should go
down the route that makes the most sense to you. I think that this will help with my perfectionism - there isn't a "perfect" way to do it, I should trust my gut and do it my way. I am coming into Turing with extremely limited coding experience, and knowing that this is all new to me, the expectation that I'll not understand everything is there.

My triggers that would send me back to a fixed mindset are:
- If I've tried approaching/researching something multiple times and it still isn't working.
- If I get advice, try it, and it doesn't work I will be frustrated - if the person helping me didn't know what was going on, how am I supposed to get it?

My peers can help by asking me questions that will help me view the problem/challenge from a new perspective, and by asking
for my help because teaching will help me learn something.

My main takeaways from the Growth Mindset Gear Up were:
- Adopt the "power of yet" vs. the "tyranny of now"
- Praise the process
- Meaning of effort & difficulty are transformed

II. Introversion / Extroversion

I really appreciated this session. I definitely consider myself to be more of an ambivert, but know that
I can come across as quite extroverted. I really struggle when I am not able to have alone time,
and the beginning of Turing was very overwhelming in that respect. It was also helpful to see
how others viewed themselves, similar to me, many people were secret introverts. I always enjoyed
opportunities to interact with the Front-End students.

III. Personal Narrative

As a former organizer, I really enjoyed this session (thank you, Beth!). Beth was really successful
in creating a safe space, and the women in our cohort who I was paired with really opened up and we were
able to have an open discussion about mental illnesses and the stigma that they carry with them.

For me I was able to speak openly about my anxiety about entering such a male dominated industry. Coming
from campaigns and non-profits, I have almost always had a female boss and a majority female colleagues,
so I know it's going to be a big adjustment once I enter the tech workforce.

IV. Grit

Despite the technical difficulties, this session was interesting in that it made me reflect on the relationship between grit and growth mindset. Coming from an education background, both of these terms were familiar to me before the session, but in the context of children. I had found that often public discourse
around grit can be quite damaging - students from less privileged backgrounds often display more grit due to their life circumstances, and so the idea of building grit for students with privilege is now an approach many schools are doing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Alex Fosco:
I feel so lucky to have had you as a partner for my first pair project! Thank you so much for your patience as we worked through the problem and figured out how to use Git. I really appreciated how you made sure to check-in about how we were working together after each pairing session, and for your collaborative work style. I feel like there were times when we would get stuck on a problem where both of our wheels would be spinning. If you encounter this in future groups, I would suggest checking in with the other person to see if they want to take a break to try and break down the problem individually, or come up with a list of questions around each of your points of confusion. I think when you reach a point in a collaborative process where both partners are coming up empty is when to try a new approach, otherwise I think that working together to drive the project forward makes sense. I thought that you were a great communicator, showed empathy towards my struggles and you chose to persevere through exhaustion when everything was breaking. Thank you for sharing your technical knowledge with me, especially when it came to the file.io.

James Anderson:
I really enjoyed working with you James. At the start of the project you definitely showed hesitation, but I knew that you had the content knowledge. After the final assessment it was clear that you received the injection of confidence that you needed, and it led to you producing at much higher levels. Trust your own knowledge going into next projects! Your voice of reason helped us from going down too many rabbit holes. I'm so impressed that you were able to figure out how to use a module, and at your prowess with boolean statements. Looking forward to working with you again in future mods!

Amara Lovato:
Amara has been a supportive force for me at Turing since before day one. Before starting she reached out to our slack channel to let us know that she was repeating the module, and that we could all reach out to her with any questions we had about Turing. I had the fortune of standing next to her on the first day, and immediately felt like I had someone who would support me through all of the newness around me. Amara encouraged me to be part of the Pahlka posse, has included me in creating a student group in Turing centered around diversity, and has helped me stop questioning whether I belong here. I am so grateful to have Amara has a cohort member, her welcoming me into the community helped shape my sense of belonging much quicker than I think it would have otherwise. I am so looking forward to continuing to get to know her and learn with her in future mods.

Robbie Smith:
Robbie has been incredibly welcoming to Mod 1 students from our first day forward. He created the pairing google sheet for us which was extremely effective and enabled us to easily schedule a time to get help from Mod 2 students. I was fortunate enough to pair with him early on and continued to do so throughout the module because of how helpful he was, especially when it came to mapping out huge projects like Headcount. I'm so grateful to have serendipitously paired with Robbie based on who worked with my schedule, he pointed me towards the Practical Object Oriented Design book my first week which really helped with my conceptual learning at the beginning.

### Being a Community Member
From Amara:
Casey is a fantastic addition to our cohort as she is full of joy, enthusiasm and has a big heart. She is passionate and committed with social causes, especially education and opportunity disparities, and I really admire her will and pursue of making the world better. She is very talented in providing a good atmosphere and conflict resolution, if there has been any tense moment in a cohort, she has always being working on making peace by listening to both sides and trying to bring people together. She is hardworking and never give up in spite of the struggle, in fact, she embraces it as an opportunity to learn. She has always a big smile to make your day brighter and a can-I-help-you offer in any problem that you have. I’m sure that she will make a positive impact in the world, she is bright, good-hearted and has the grit to do it until she achieves it.

From Robbie:
So, I had the pleasure of pairing with Casey several times over the course of the module and it was always a good experience. It is nice to see how hard she works, and every time we paired together she was always ready to work. I think that we could use more people like her. She was always open to constructive criticism and provided thoughtful feedback.
### Playing a Part

- I unloaded and loaded each dishwasher at least twice every day
- I make coffee whenever it's empty
- I listen to fellow cohort members if they need a listening ear
- I help fellow cohort members when I can
- I went to many Pahlka meetings, they were fun!
- I'm excited to represent 1611 BE in the SAB next module
