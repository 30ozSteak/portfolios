### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Eric Wahlgren-Sauro: I'm so happy that we were able to work together on a project again. Working in a group project can be sometimes stressful but working with a friend like you makes things easier. I will always appreciate your desire to help me grow and your honesty. Thank you for being such a good friend and for always calling me on my flaws.

To Charlotte Moore: You are a powerhouse!!! You impressed me the first time we paired and you still do. Management skills, problem solving, wit, determination are only a few things I can say about you. Please continue teaching others while being kind and accepting. I know this can sound cheesy but you will become an irreplaceable developer and any company will be lucky to have you on their team.

To Spencer Carter: I actually thought they wouldn't have the guts to pair the loudest students together but they did and it was a blast working with you. Trust yourself that you know what you are doing and you will achieve your goals faster than you realize. Please be less hard on yourself and continue being the loud sassy pants you are.

### Being a Community Member

From Eric Wahlgren-Sauro:
G and I have become good friends at Turing. Consequently, we know each others blind spots. This is a helpful benefit when on a team with people you don't know. She'd feel comfortable to call me on my shit and I could call her on her's. We spent many hours back-to-back solving problems and building features. Working with her reminders me of how far our skills have come since module one.

From Charlotte Moore:
Despite the struggles you faced, I really think you kicked ass on this project. You were able to produce two of the most complex features of the application, and you were always pushing for more work. Your attitude and work ethic is amazing and it really inspired me when I was struggling during this project. The perseverance you showed on this project will be invaluable to you as you move onto a new career. Youâ€™re awesome, keep doing what you do.

### Playing a Part

  As I repeater, I know how it feels to feel behind and I was always available to talk to some of the repeaters from 1701 back end and also front end. I did my best to keep them from dropping out of the course. Programming is hard and it will take just a little bit of time for things to seems more natural.

#### Spike

  I co-led a spike on how to set up your bash profile.
