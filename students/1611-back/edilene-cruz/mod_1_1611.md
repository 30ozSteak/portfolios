# Edilene Da Cruz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to master my ruby skills by finding new ways of using methods and enumerables. I'm hoping to improve how to break down a problem into small pieces and help my classmates when possible.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/jungle_beat.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project is super fun as you are making a basic drum machine program. The drum machine plays sounds from commands initiated at the Terminal. To complete the project, knowledge of linked lists is needed.

Notes:

###### 1. Functional Expectations
4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension
###### 2. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
###### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques



#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/battleship2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

The goal is to create a terminal version of the board game Battleship. This project has a lot of moving pieces and required me to break down the porject into very small pieces and connect a lot of moving pieces. Unfortunately, I started the project on a weak base and tried to restart it and failed to complete it. I'm hoping to come back and finish it.

Notes:

- Wasn't able to get through a game. Crashed at laying out my ships.
- Love the pirate speak.
- Good code, it's just not all there
- Able to speak about process and logic like a real developer.

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* **4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring**

### 2. Enumerable & Collections
* **3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques**

### 3. Test-Driven Development
**3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests**

### 4. REPL Interface
**4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the gameplay**

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components
**3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage**

### 6. Functional Expectations
**2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

(description)

Assessed By: Ilana

Notes:
- got through crack and an extension
- talked about division of responsibility
- tests are working but only if code is commented out (we talked about commented out code to make things work)
- tests need to be more robust

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

##### Feedback to me

Edilene,

I want to take this moment to thank you for an amazing paired project experience. I will be honest and admit that I was skeptical how this pairing would go due to never participated in one. Your ability to manipulate data and be able to follow it as it moves from class to class is by far amazing. Listening to your explanations of your implementations of methods and objects really helped in making Enigma an enjoyable project. I know that you preach TDD and we followed it the first couple days but we veered from it as the project got bigger. Causing us to “hack” the code and write tests after code. Staying focused on TDD will help you with your time management by saving you unnecessary reformatting time. Your test writing abilities are an area of strength and I would enjoy seeing you thoroughly master this skill as you seem to be a natural at it. Thanks again for being a helpful, informative, well-rounded partner and good luck on your next pairing.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth mindset

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

The first at Turing will probably one of the hardest one. We are being thrown in a new environment, trying to learn as much as we can while feeling lost the whole time. This gear up was everything we needed: an assurance that the feeling was normal, that we are not "ready yet" to move to the next steps and that other students have been in our shoes and that they survived and thrived. The concept of rewiring our brains to tell us that we don't fail that we are just not ready to move to the next phase is absolutely brilliant and one that I will continue to apply in my life and I will teach others that concept.
