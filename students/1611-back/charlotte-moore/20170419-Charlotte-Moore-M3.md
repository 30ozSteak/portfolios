-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Ruby Style
3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
### 2. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### 3. Testing
4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.
### 4. Progression/Completion
3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
### 5. Workflow
4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects for this Mod were APICurious and the Personal Project. In APICurious I consumed the Reddit API and recreated certian functionality of that site. The two most challenging parts of that project were the OAuth and consuming and displaying comments. Fot the Personal Project, I chose to do sentiment analysis using the Watson Alchemy Language API. Initially, I chose to create my project using Node/Express, but ultimately my skill level with JavaScript (or rather, lack thereof) made it impossible to continue on that path, and I threw together a rails app in the last two days. 

### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

In this project I consumed the Reddit API to reproduce certian functionality. A User could OAuth through Reddit and view their subscribed sub-reddits, view the top posts on those sub-reddits, and view the comments for those posts. 

(evaluation scores): I chose not to be graded. 

### Info is Everywhere

* [NODE GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/info_is_everywhere)
* [RAILS GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/personal_project)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)

For my Personal Project I chose to use the Watson Alchemy Language API to do sentiment analysis. My initial plan was to use this API to analyze news articles and use a data visualization to display the result. This has proven to be very difficult. 

## C: Group Work & Projects


This Mod we did two group projects, Rails Engine and Cloney Island. In Rails Engine we seeded data from another Turing Project (Sales Engine) and created an internal API with that data. I worked with Katy on Rails Engine, which was awesome. For Cloney Island, my team and I cloned KickStarter. While we struggled with certian parts of the project, ultimately I was really pleased with the end result. 

### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

For Rails Engine, Katy and I seeded and exposed the data from Sales Engine in an internal API.

#### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

Note: Test harness fails the first time - appears to be issue with the harness and not the code - has been looked at by multiple instructors

All pass on the second run, consistently

* 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

#### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

Note: 99.84 coverage - intermittant failures but all related to the same issue and students can fix them on the fly. Only happens on instructor's machine. Of course.

* 3.5: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.
