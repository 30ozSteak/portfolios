## A: End of Module Assessment
Evaluator: Andrew

Student: Charlotte

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### Conceptual Understanding

  * 4: Developer is able to describe concepts with a high degree of specificity and accuracy without assistance
  * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning
  * 2: Developer demonstrates some gaps in understanding when asked for additional detail
  * 1: Developer has fundamental misconceptions about Rails, MVCs, the web, or related topics

### Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

  * 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

###  Feature Completeness

* 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

###  ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

  * 4: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods independently and can articulately discuss the difference between relationships at the model and database level

### Rails Style

  * 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes

### Testing

  * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

### Collaboration

 * 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## B: Non Evaluated Projects

### Rails Mini-Project

* [Mini-Project Repo](https://github.com/CjMoore/path_minder)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

This was the first project where we were able to come up with our own idea and be creative with rails. I chose to build an app that was based on a need I encountered while playing the game Pathfinder. In this app, I used one-to-many and many-to-many relationships to provide the user with a quick reference for combat scenarios. The app is intended to be a tool for the Game Master, and allow him/her to keep track of character and creature stats in individual combat scenarios. The most valuable thing I took away from this project was from working through the process of creating an app from an idea. When I started this project I was over ambitious and as I worked through it I had to figure out where I could cut back. I learned a lot about my own limitations as well as strengths. 


### Mix-Master

* [Mix-Master Repo](https://github.com/CjMoore/mix_master)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)

In this project we built an app that used one-to-one and many-to-many relationships between tracks albums and artists. The structure of this project was that of a tutorial. It walked us through how to build a rails app using TDD. The most valuable thing I took away from this project was learning how to follow errors to produce functionality. At first the order in which the tests pushed functionality was uncomfortable. I wanted to do things in an order that made more sense to me. This would mean building the migrations and models first. Forcing myself to follow errors was really valuable, as I learned that they can help me create functionality that I didn't immediately know how to produce. I've continued to use this strategy which has been incredibly helpful.

### One Nation Many Voices

* [ONMV-Backend Repo](https://github.com/One-Nation-Many-Voices/ONMV-backend)

This mod I had the opportunity to work with two Mod 4 front-end students, Christine Gamble and Chelsea Skovgaard, as well as Casey and Katy, on a project called One Nation Many Voices. The app is intended to be a tool for civic engagement and protesting. The end goal is an app that takes information about protests and civil actions from facebook, meetup, and twitter and puts them in one place. Ideally the user would be able to search for events in their area by category and save the event to a calendar. When we began this project we knew that we didn't have the knowledge or experience to produce all the desired functionality, so we broke it down into a manageable goal. We used a live google doc that lists Town Hall meetings and office hours with Senators and Congressmen and were able to seed it into a database of events. We were then able to create end-points for Christine and Chelsea to hit and do their front-end magic. I learned an incredible amount from doing this project. When we began I had absolutely no concept of how front-end and back-end interacted with eachother, and wouldn't have been able to tell you what an API is. I feel much more comfortable going into Mod 3 with the knowledge gained through this project. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

We built a web app with sinatra that tracked bike share stations, trips, and weather conditions.

### Evaluation Rubric

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

#### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

#### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

#### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
