## B: Non Evaluated Projects

### Rails Mini-Project

* [Mini-Project Repo](https://github.com/CjMoore/path_minder)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

This was the first project where we were able to come up with our own idea and be creative with rails. I chose to build an app that was based on a need I encountered while playing the game Pathfinder. In this app, I used one-to-many and many-to-many relationships to provide the user with a quick reference for combat scenarios. The app is intended to be a tool for the Game Master, and allow him/her to keep track of character and creature stats in individual combat scenarios. The most valuable thing I took away from this project was from working through the process of creating an app from an idea. When I started this project I was over ambitious and as I worked through it I had to figure out where I could cut back. I learned a lot about my own limitations as well as strengths. 


### Mix-Master

* [Mix-Master Repo](https://github.com/CjMoore/mix_master)

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mix_master/1_getting_started)

In this project we built an app that used one-to-one and many-to-many relationships between tracks albums and artists. The structure of this project was that of a tutorial. It walked us through how to build a rails app using TDD. The most valuable thing I took away from this project was learning how to follow errors to produce functionality. At first the order in which the tests pushed functionality was uncomfortable. I wanted to do things in an order that made more sense to me. This would mean building the migrations and models first. Forcing myself to follow errors was really valuable, as I learned that they can help me create functionality that I didn't immediately know how to produce. I've continued to use this strategy which has been incredibly helpful.

### One Nation Many Voices

* [ONMV-Backend Repo](https://github.com/One-Nation-Many-Voices/ONMV-backend)

This mod I had the opportunity to work with two Mod 4 front-end students, Christine Gamble and Chelsea Skovgaard, as well as Casey and Katy, on a project called One Nation Many Voices. The app is intended to be a tool for civic engagement and protesting. The end goal is an app that takes information about protests and civil actions from facebook, meetup, and twitter and puts them in one place. Ideally the user would be able to search for events in their area by category and save the event to a calendar. When we began this project we knew that we didn't have the knowledge or experience to produce all the desired functionality, so we broke it down into a manageable goal. We used a live google doc that lists Town Hall meetings and office hours with Senators and Congressmen and were able to seed it into a database of events. We were then able to create end-points for Christine and Chelsea to hit and do their front-end magic. I learned an incredible amount from doing this project. When we began I had absolutely no concept of how front-end and back-end interacted with eachother, and wouldn't have been able to tell you what an API is. I feel much more comfortable going into Mod 3 with the knowledge gained through this project. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Ryanspink1/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

We built a web app with sinatra that tracked bike share stations, trips, and weather conditions.

### Evaluation Rubric

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

#### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

#### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

#### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

## D: Professional Development

### Project Management

Prior to this lesson I had heard of Agile development, but I really had no idea what it meant. After having implemented it in Bike-Share and Little Shop I can absolutely see the advantage it brings to web development, particularly in comparison to the waterfall process. This lesson was invaluable to me as PM on our Little Shop project. Our team communcated really well throughout the project despite circumstances that could have been really difficult to overcome, specifically one of our teammates was out of town for three days. The team was able to meet at least once a day (for the most part) to go over what work had been done and what work needed to be done. This helped tremendously when communicating with the 'client' at our check-ins as the team was always on the same page. 

### Feedback

The most valuable feedback that I've gotten at Turing is that I need to open up and communicate more. I'm natrually introverted, but I realize that's not an excuse. It takes me a long time to become comfortable with people 

### Flower Exercise

### Mentor 

## E: Community

### Tragedy of the Commons

### Debugging the Gender Gap

### Universal Basic Income

## F: Feedback

** (From: Andy) **

Charlotte Moore:
    It's been a terrific time getting to know you during Mod 2. Thank you
  for being so responsive to questions, and generally amazingly thorough in
  answering them. You helped clarify more than one thing that I didn't
  understand this inning, and I really appreciate that. I'm glad you
  started opening up and talking more. That's a difficult barrier for anyone to
  overcome, but you're breaking through it awesomely! Given that it seems we're
  going to be heading into the realm of networking and job-hunting next Mod, I
  think it would be helpful for you to keep up progress in that area. It's an
  absolute pleasure having you in our cohort, and I'm really looking forward to
  seeing what Mod 3 has in store. It's gonna be a good time.
  
  ** (From: Courtney) **
  
  Charlotte, I really enjoyed working with you on the Little Shop project. I observed your technical strengths to include: testing, debugging styling issues, the MVC framework, and a particular acumen for strategic planning. As a project manager, you considered everyone's opinion and input as equal and frequently engaged in forward/big picture thinking that kept us on a successful track at a manageable pace. As a peer, you consistently stopped what you were doing to help others work through difficult problems and took on many of the unexpected tasks that came up throughout the project. In the future, you may find it useful to advocate for the tasks you specifically want to ensure you're getting the learning experience you desire out of a project. You were very communicative on Slack and GitHub, and your thorough code reviews helped us verify / challenge our assumptions about what our code was doing / not doing. I particularly appreciate the attention to detail you exercised in going through all of the user stories and code at different milestones throughout the project. I enjoyed all of my interactions with you, and I'm proud of the application we built together.
