# Charlotte Moore - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goal in this first module was to engage myself fully in the community and commit myself to learning the material. I feel as if I met these goals over the course of the last six weeks. I joined and attended the Pahlka Posse, and utilized the community pairing resources. I set out with the intention of developing the ability to use ruby effectively and I am happy with the level of proficiency I have at this point. I had some programming experience prior to starting this module, and had a strong conceptual foundation. That said I struggled tremendously at the beginning to produce functionality from that conceptual understanding. By working through the projects and the materials provided, such as drills, I think I have developed a strong foundation on which to build my skills.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

With every project I could see my ability to use ruby grow. I really enjoyed the challenge of working on the projects, and believe they are what really drove the development of my understanding. I struggled tremendously with being able to translate my conceptual understanding into functional application. However, as each project presented a new set of challenges, the exposure to new expectations advanced my ability to recognize how to execute new functionality. When we were given the Binary Search Tree I had no idea how to even start, however by the time we kicked-off Headcount I had was able to not only come up with a strategy, but also implement it.  

### Date Night

Repo: https://github.com/CjMoore/Date-Night

Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown

Build a Binary Search Tree

Assessed by: Mike

### Notes:

* Not everything was an attr-accessor <3
* include method loses data during execution, does not traverse the tree properly
* 36 tests total.

### Scores:

### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

Notes:
* 71 tests, 89 assertions, all passing
* 5 Violations of sanitation
* 1 failure of spec harness
* generally well written, some opportunities for refactoring
* I like how File IO was pulled out
* Look into sad path testing and predicate methods

### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 3: Five or fewer complaints


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I only did one group project this Module, but I really enjoyed working with my partner. We struggled a lot with Complete Me, but ultimately I think we got a lot farther than I would have gotten on my own. It was a huge challenge to coordinate writing code, not only because of my introverted nature, but also because of time. I found that it took a lot more time to get through parts of the project, simply because we both had to have an established understanding before we moved forward. Overall, I would say I learned as much about ruby as I did about communication working on this project.

### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/CjMoore/CompleteMe)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/complete_me)

Build an autocomplete program using a trie data structure

Assessed by: Nate

* Missing suggest and supporting feature
* Clear and concise tests. We talked about efficiency in the future
* Could make better use of words as arrays, althogh I wasn't able to easily get it working
* Would have liked more examples of enumerables

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## D: Professional Skills
The Gear Ups and professional development sessions were really useful in terms of providing resources. The professional development sessions helped me understand how to think of and market myself in professional terms. The Gear Up sessions were focused on opening up a new perspective on motivation and communication.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**(From:Me, To: Beth)**
Your positive attitude helped me stay focused when I became really frustrated with this project. When I wanted to give up you were a great source of encouragement, and you really pushed me to keep going when it seemed like we weren't getting anywhere. I don't think our dynamic helped advance our project because we fed off of eachother's confusion and ended up going in circles a lot. I felt like we were on the same page for a lot of stuff, but we were on the wrong page and both of us had trouble seeing that. I think it was difficult for both of us to step back from the problem, which contributed to the mire we found ourselves in. You were great at seeking out help and improved your testing a lot over the course of this project. Despite the frustrations, it was great working with you.

### Being a Community Member

**(From Beth)**
I think you had great passion about the project and wanting to succeed. You showed up on time, put in extra effort. There was never a moment where I doubted if you were in for the long haul. And thanks for letting me take over a lot of the testing. That was important for me to learn and I really appreciated it.
I think we might have had that tunnel vision with our project. There was a point where we were both spiraling and feeling defeated. We should have met at Turing instead of the coffee shop so we could have grabbed some help. But that’s a hindsight thing. You’re github skills are getting there! We probably should have outlined how we were going to merge, pull, create branches and all that. We need to whiteboard, psuedo code, and test before we write any real code. I think we got into trouble when we started hacking away at it.

### Playing a Part

As a module one student I think I helped the larger Turing community by focusing on my goals and learning. I think by using resources, such as pairing, I helped other students contribute to the larger community. I hope in the next modules I will have the opportunity to give back more.
