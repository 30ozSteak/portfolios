I think having subconscious bias about the demographic of a technical team is dangerous territory because it keeps the team from being the best they can be. It ends up limit the number of applicants for a specific job. 
I am not strongly for diversity quotas because I don't think it necessarily helps the demographic issue. The hiring process is rife with random chance and opportunity, and I think that hiring because of someone's demographic is inherently racist/sexist/--ist to a demographic. The hiring staff should hire based on qualifications and cultural fit.
I think giving people opportunities to reflect on when they've encountered bias personally will help them consider how they can have less bias. Also using tools that help remove sources of unconscious bias like changing names, removing pictures, etc.
I don't think it's very effective in changing people's opinions, as it didn't change mine. I would like to see some evidence in support of the idea that 1/3 of peple....The visualization is interesting, but I don't understand why natural segregation is a bad idea if it actually occurs. People who are similar often have similar values and it's part of our evolutionary biology to be with people who are like us. It makes us feel safe and safety leads to survival. Complicit segregation should never be enforced, but neither should complicit diversity. As long as someone isn't harmig someone else, we can't enforce these norms in good conscience with respect to the freedom of the individual.
