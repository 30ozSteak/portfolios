#### Evaluation Notes

Code organization and where logic lives:
* there were opportunities to pull logic out of the controller
  * fat model, skinny controller paradigm
  * making a class that would return us the object we want after parsing through params

Collaboartion and Workflow:
* Making cards into a user story
* using integration with waffle & issue numbers in branch names
* opportunities to have code reviews in pull requests
  * it's a place to discuss the code
  * have more clearly defined GitHub expectations

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. ActiveRecord

* 4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

#### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

#### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3.5: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

#### 5. Testing

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GearUp URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I think having subconscious bias about the demographic of a technical team is dangerous territory because it keeps the team from being the best they can be. It ends up limit the number of applicants for a specific job.  I am not strongly for diversity quotas because I don't think it necessarily helps the demographic issue. The hiring process is rife with random chance and opportunity, and I think that hiring because of someone's demographic is inherently racist/sexist/--ist to a demographic. The hiring staff should hire based on qualifications and cultural fit.

I think giving people opportunities to reflect on when they've encountered bias personally will help them consider how they can have less bias. Also using tools that help remove sources of unconscious bias like changing names, removing pictures, etc.

I don't think it's very effective in changing people's opinions, as it didn't change mine. I would like to see some evidence in support of the idea that 1/3 of peple....The visualization is interesting, but I don't understand why natural segregation is a bad idea if it actually occurs. People who are similar often have similar values and it's part of our evolutionary biology to be with people who are like us. It makes us feel safe and safety leads to survival. Complicit segregation should never be enforced, but neither should complicit diversity. As long as someone isn't harmig someone else, we can't enforce these norms in good conscience with respect to the freedom of the individual.

#### Deubbing the Gender Gap

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/meyerhoferc/455fcab7c1ba50f5cf8e648fa918b962)

My main takeaway from this session was the idea that an interview with a company should be a two-way interview. I am interviewing them as much as they are me. The process of reflecting and writing for this exercise was helpful in identifying and narrowing down my priorities and dealbreakers. I hope to use it as a guide for targeting company outreach next module.
