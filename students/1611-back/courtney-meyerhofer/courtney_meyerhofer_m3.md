## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)


#### Apicurious - Reddit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meyerhoferc/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

This project was an opportunity to explore consuming an external API. Using the Reddit API, a user can:
   * sign in with their Reddit account 
   * view their account details
   * view a list of the subreddits they are subscribbed to
   * view posts on the subreddit they are subscribed to
   * view nested comments for posts

**Evaluation Notes**

Testing
* overall well tested
* opportunity to stub out more for feature and model tests
* VCR should probably only be used explicitly for request tests

User Experience
* solid, simple design but not production - client ready quality

Code Quality
* great use of POROs and services
* some repetition exists in using the same URL a few times in the RedditService

**Feature Delivery**
Completion

3: Developer delivered all planned features.

Organization

4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
Technical Quality

**Test-Driven Development**

4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.

**Code Quality**

4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
Product Experience

**User Experience**

3.5: The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application 3.5: The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meyerhoferc/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

RalesEngine uses Rails and ActiveRecord to serve up JSON from SalesEngine data.

**Evaluation Notes**

Testing:
balancing tests: unit & request tests should have different setup
mocking / stubbing for requests tests

Code Quality:
* not 100% rest-ful, but that's okay
* be articulate about advantages & disaadvantages

API Desgin:
* look into member & collection
* sits within resource to function like a namespace
* push any logic down to the model level

Queries:
* could have customers with pending invoices as an instance method on a merchant that calls the customer class

**Evaluation**
