(Intro)

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meyerhoferc/date-night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

I used a binary search tree to sort scores and titles of movies from a text file.
Some functionality included sorting the movie data into a hash, finding the maximum
and minimum scores in the tree, and determining the depth of of scores within the tree.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/headcount)
* [Self Evaluation]()

Headcount is a system that parses CSVs to create a database of information from Data.gov concerning public school data. There is a data access layer, an analysis layer, and a relationships layer to the system. The data access layer allows the system to be queried for specific data for a district or the state of Colorado. The analysis layer returns statistical analysis about the data, and the relationships layer answers questions relating to multiple data sets.

## D: Professional Skills
The professional and personal skills developed during this module include mindsets and working styles as well as perseverance and whole group connection.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [Session URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)
I really enjoyed the Growth Mindset Gear Up. I first learned about growth mindset when teaching AP science classes during my previous career. Teaching my students about growth mindset ended up really changing my life. I began to think about what I really wanted and what I would do if I wasn't so afraid to fail. Learning to program and having a more fulfilling career was what I decided I truly wanted. I've experienced this module that celebrating others' growth and success and letting others inspire me instills more of a growth mindset in me. I've also observed that being tired and failing despite having high amounts of effort sometimes triggers a fixed mindset in me.

#### Introvert/Extrovert Working Style

* [Session URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_norms.markdown)
My main takeawway from this Gear Up was learning about other working styles that I do not possess. I've always identified as an introvert, even though I enjoy talking with people. I'm very glad that Turing took the time to draw attention to different working styles because I definitely feel like school settings are oftentimes more catered to the extrovert working style.

#### Public Narrative

* [Session URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_public_narrative.markdown)
I felt like this Gear Up really brought everyone together as a cohort and helped me reconnect to my motivation for coming to Turing. I feel like everyone has unique stories on what brought them to Turing, and it was enjoyable to hear and share those experiences. Sharing our stories and connecting with others allowed us to explore how far we've come in module 1 and how we can support each other.

#### Grit

* [Session URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
I think that I developed some grit before Turing and it's serving me well now. However, just as there are two sides to every coin, a case occassionally arises where using grit to persevere and just keep working can sometimes be a detriment, especially when I need to take a break. Grit and growth mindset are definitely intertwined concepts. I would distinguish them as such: growth mindset is a mindset that allows one to pursue their interests and persevere in spite of failures while grit is a tool that growth mindset calls on to accomplish its goals. While I had been introduced to growth mindset before coming to Turing, I think that seeing how I persevere with grit and the success that it brings is a positive cycle that feeds on itself, allowing me to have more confidence and dream bigger with growth mindset.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding Part I

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p1)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables: LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtney-meyerhofer-821a22ab)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables: Resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/iqg6r7dlokd)
I found this session very valuable because it introduced me to the job hunt part of the technology world. I learned about how to showcase experience and projects in professional profiles and resumes, and I learned about the importance of having a succinct story for my profile or an elevator pitch. I found the portion involving writing a summary about myself and my skills the most challenging. My summary is still quite rough and I don't think it is accurate yet. I don't know exactly what part of the tech sector I want to eventually work in, and my short term goals after Turing are very different from my long term goals. I think that as I learn more from Turing and about myself, I'll be able to answer these questions better.

#### Learning to Pair

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/learning_to_pair)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables: DTR Memo](https://gist.github.com/meyerhoferc/2efb6bc4302c099e33405e051da9727b)
The main takeaways from the Learning to Pair session were pairing styles, communication systems, and expectation management. I think it's important to clarify the expectations for a pairing segment in terms of how and what is being paired on as well as the format for the pair. I like the idea of communicating to someone more advanced than me to not steal my learning and to switch roles frequently.

#### Feedback I

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/feedback_1)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables: Written Feedback](https://gist.github.com/meyerhoferc/307268bf7f41b6c5c41178b90430f2a9)
A major takeaway from this session was learning to give and receive feedback with grace and humility. I've incorporated celebrating success and providing specific, actionable, and kind feedback into pairings. I've observed that it's often difficult to receive feedback because it can challenge my view of myself. I think it's important to have a growth mindset in those moments and to remember that we're all here to learn. I'm here because I don't know what I'm doing, and I'm learning to view feedback as a gift that can help me improve.

#### Peronsal Branding Part II

* [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/personal_branding_p2)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/meyerhoferc/66a6307064b785f66ad602ef9581f0d8)
From this session, I learned about writing website copy for both technical and non-technical people that will be visiting my personal site. Particularly interesting to me was how word choice conveys personality, especially with the examples shown in the lesson. I found it difficult to write about myself, but I think Lia's advice to write for myself and to be authentic helped me write something I feel proud to place on a website.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Katy, I really enjoyed whiteboarding the CompleteMe project with you. Technically, I think your strengths were in testing and having a healthy skepticism concerning every idea that was brought up. When you said that we wouldn't understand if #select was working until we tested it against #suggest, that really deepened my understanding of integration tests. I also enjoyed receiving feedback from you on the differences between functionality and implementation.In terms of collaboration, I appreciate that you consistently called for check-ins, defining goals, and declaring break time. You always celebrated victories and I felt very supported by you when I became frustrated with my errors and was feeling overwhelmed.I appreciate that you don't avoid conflict, and I think you should voice your frustrations earlier in the next project. In your next group project, consider structuring regular breaks consistently and communicating your needs more frequently. If you need a moment to process an idea through writing/drawing/coding/prying independently, don't be afraid to ask. I think those moments really ramped up your conceptual understanding of the project and you were able to contribute even more effectively. I also think that while you had a healthy skepticism of new ideas, it may be helpful to entertain the rabbit hole for a few minutes. You could even set a time limit for how long to spend on a rabbit hole so it doesn't waste too much time.

Valerie, I really enjoyed whiteboarding the CompleteMe project with you. Technically, I think your strengths were in generating ideas and questioning every idea put forward. I also saw that your understanding of recursion greatly improved when we were writing recursive methods. You were also an excellent whiteboarder, and I wish you had whiteboarded more. When you were whiteboarding, you did a really good job at explaining what you were doing and why. I appreciate that you entertained every idea I had, even if it seemed like it was a rabbit hole. This made me feel included and like I was valued as a collaborator. In your next project, assert yourself earlier. I appreciated when you told us that you felt like we were leaving you behind. Make sure to ask lots of questions and stop someone if you feel like you aren't following. I think the times when you were learning the most was when you were driving the project. If there's a concept you aren't understanding,
it may be a good time to drive so you can ask questions while pairing. You brought a lot of excellent resources to the project by scheduling pairings and getting outside help. Without these resources, I don't think our project would've been nearly as successful.

### Being a Community Member
From Max:
Courtney, I've really enjoyed getting to know you during this time at Turing. I'm especially impressed with your service on the Student Advisory Board. You've been a leader in helping bring our cohort together as a community and also as a representative to the instructors and staff, shouldering those additional responsibilities with patience and grace. I'm glad to find someone who also gets excited about the intellectual joy of programming and I look forward to further learning and exploration together. You're an excellent problem solver, have great instincts, and I've learned that I can rely on you as a sounding board for ideas and to provide a clear mind when I get stuck. I hope we get a chance to pair on a project in the future.

### Playing a Part

I played a part in the Turing community by participating as a representative on the Student Advisory Board.
In this role, I forwarded along student concerns to teachers and facilities managers, participated in SAB meetings,
facilitated Cohort Retrospectives each week and was generally intentional about making myself available and supportive
to other cohort members. My peers suggested a Mod 1 Monday Lunch roulette so there would be more non-academic mixing among students. I organized this by assigning groups and sending reminders.
