Valerie Trudell - Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

First beginning the module I wanted to learn to make running programs, that are complete and mature, accomplishing complex tasks. I set out to show up everyday to class, present and ready to learn. Lastly, I wanted to learn to program the thing I set out to program, and when encountering problems I didn't understand; I would push through them and not just find a way around them.

* [Original Assignment]
  https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/super_fizz.markdown

Description
===============================================================

Super Fizz is, the commonly known interview question, that asks to replace the numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5 with a Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz. This SuperFizz puts a little spin on it. Instead of 100 numbers there are 1000, it adds an additional 7 to the divisible numbers list to be replaced with Super, and when all three occur the goal is to replace the number with SuperFizzBuzz.

* [Original Assignment]
  https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown

Description
===============================================================
Sorting Suite contained three separate sorting requirements: bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort. Bubble sort asks to sort given inputs so that inputs are switching place with each other so that the input being switching bubbles all the way up to its proper place. Insertion sort is takes the input and puts it in its proper place. The last was merge sort which took the inputs one by one the sorted side was to the left and unsorted to the right. After the “line” would move up one input, the input was taken and put in its proper place.

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_cohort_vision.markdown

They talked about how having a growth mindset amongst
young students could either set them up to fail or succeed and when posed with an impossible dilemma; the children that are in a fix mind set where failing is not a good thing found it harder to grow, and those with a growth mindset, where failing was more like a learning experience were more capable of growth and not only that they reach levels the fixed mind set kids never would. This resonated with me, because I personally try to always be "contributing to the good", and I think the growth mind set sticks a cord in that, because you don't look at your challenges as obstacles but opportunities, and you don't tell you're self you can't you just try, and I think in the end when you're just trying to make the most of an opportunity you're see life for the most that it could be, and thus life is slightly more beautiful, and that is contributing to the good.

  2. What are the values that drive you?
  3. How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
  4. Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?

  In Groups
  1. How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
  2. Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?
  3. What values are similar/different?
  4. How do you think these differences/similarites will impact your cohort?

Grit 
======================================================== 
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown

Think of a time at Turing when you've been tempted to give up.
	•	Is it possible to interpret that experience through the lens of grit, i.e. your grit to get through a difficult situation was under strain?
	⁃	Battleship was very difficult and it didn’t end well. I came to a peak breaking point during the extension over the break. I couldn’t get things to work; and I just felt like closing my laptop and never opening the project again. If I were to go back, with the intent to apply more grit, I would have push harder and longer to understand and complete. I felt like I didn’t push myself as hard because I felt I knew I was going to fail anyway. 
	•	Is that lens helpful?
	•	 	…yes
	•	Is it in any way problematic (emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)?
	⁃	I have a tendency to push myself. My goals are something like: coming in at 7am, leaving at 9pm, weekends are not break days but push days. To warm up and cool off exercises before and after attempting anything. With just these goals in mind I spend copious hours in front of my computer and often don’t break for hours. I think sometimes it becomes problematic; because I don’t take care of myself. 

Growth mindset is a necessary for grit. Both growth mindset and the concept of grit speak to one's ability to deal with the ego-stripping experience of failure and challenge that accompany learning and growth.
	•	How would you define the distinction between these two? 
      Grit is pushing to complete a thing; growth midset is, even after you've pushed and pushed, and your result is not at  
      or near your intended goal; you don't step back and except it as a failure; you take the experience of not meeting 
      expectations and recognized the areas you need growth in; and continue to grow in those areas going forward.  
	•	How can they work together? 
      When your work is full of grit you're committing yourself completly to the task at hand, even when you feel like
      stoping and excepting failure; and when you have a growth mindset, you except that even though you did put in your all,
      and your outcome doesnot meet your goal you never say to yourself that you failed; its learning the ways that you can
      be better at the thing you attempted
	•	How has your growth mindset impacted your grit in Module 1? 
      Several times I feel like I've hit a wall; there is no more that I can give than I have already given. Having a growth
      mind set reminds me that during those time; more so when those times didn't equate to sucess, I have not failed; I'm
      just not a software developer yet.

Summary

    Really like the message of your summary but there are a lot of “I” statements. You might play with the structure a bit 
    and see if you can rearrange some sentences so that it reads a bit more smoothly. 
    There are some type-o’s as well as words that are frequently repeated that you may want to change. Here is my suggestion-
    I'm a software developer driven by solving problems and creating a better future. I have always wanted to help people and 
    now know how; by creating new technologies to solve complex problems. 
    Give me one more sentence at the end related to teamwork, collaboration and generally expanding on your notion of 
    “working with great people”

Skills

    Follow summary with skills section
    Continue to add to this area outlining your technical specialties (languages, frameworks, testing and tools). Ideally you
    want 12-20 items by the end of the program. 


Projects

    Follow skills with a project section that includes 2-3 of your favorite projects

    Answer the following questions-
        What problem does it solve? 
        What does it allow the user to do? 
        What is the high level overview of the project? 
        What stack is this app built in? 
        If you worked in a group, what was your focus?
    Deploy and repository with clickable web addresses 


Experience

    Follow Projects with Experience
    Title as Experience rather than Employment
    Format should start with title followed by company
    Use bullet points (3-5 per organization) & focus on the value that you brought to the organization rather than the    
    individual tasks performed.
    Turing can fall under experience or education but having it fall under experience brings it closer to the top and ties in 
    with your self identification as a software developer. Titling this category as “experience” rather than work 
    history/employment allows for it to include things aside from paid employment


Education

    Move to the end of the document


LINKEDIN

    You need a picture

    Summary should expand on rather than duplicate your resume summary. Tell us about yourself, your passions and your ambitions in a short paragraph or two. Ok to talk about Turing but don’t make it a focal point.
    You’ll want to add Projects as you complete them, after summary. If working with a team, one team member should create a project link to the code source, give overview and then link team members. 
    Add Turing to Experience with open-ended date (16/06-present) and provide detailed descriptions via paragraph format for each previous employer as well as information on what you’re doing at Turing.
    Keep Turing in Education (IE, put it in Education AND Experience) - in order to connect with other alumni/future students
    Skills-don’t forget to add your tech skills!

#### Bike Share

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/edilenedacruz/bike-share)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

## Description
-----------------
In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

This application will collect data in two ways: 1) through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information, and 2) by consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application will provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

## Evaluation Notes
---------------------

    Good homepage and styling. First impressions position.
    Navigation throughout site looks pretty good.
    Missing CSS on a specific pages of the site. Will look into it in code review.
    ActiveRecord is generally clean and good use of methods. Some more advanced AR is not quite there.
    Good code structure and organization for a first attempt. A little more refactoring possible but good.
    Tests don't quite hit the mark. The feature tests don't always test desired information like the dynamic content. Also not much use of anything other than "has_content". Model tests don't test custom methods.

# Brandon

Hey Val!

I enjoyed working with you on Bikeshare. I was inspired by your willingness to spend extensive time on a project. You gave me a burst of energy to continue on our project when I would've usually tapped out at some time around 10pm. Your influence in a group project weighs heavily on the end results. You have an overall positive demenor and are very communicative. You were effective in delegating tasks, recognizing individual weaknesses and strengths and never portraid negativity under pressure. You were also never hesitant to give your input. Bottom line; I enjoy being aroud you. Thanks for the experience!

# Alex

Valerie,
It was great working with you on Bikeshare. I admired your work ethic and that you wanted to learn new concepts. You were always in a good mood which made working with you fun and relaxed. You also did a great job of laying the foundation for the styling of the project, and at a time when no one was really familiar with it. You were selected as the project manager and you should have done a better job of taking charge of the project and being the deciding voice to settle any decisions regarding the project. I enjoyed working with you, and I'm looking forward to pairing with you again.

# G

Valerie,

You are impressively determined, strong and so positive. Even in the hardest of time, you kept being enthusiastic and motivated us all to push through to finish as much as we could for our Bike Share project. I'm very happy that you were not afraid of voicing your opinions and visions from the moment the project started. It's very apparent how fascinated you are with programming and how much more you want to learn. I'm excited to see how far your passion will take you. It was a great pleasure working with you and I'm hoping we get paired again in the future!

# Casey

Valerie, it was so great working with you on this Little Shop. I hope you know what
a #GirlBoss you are, in general, but also when it comes to coding. I know that
you felt like your contributions weren't as much as others in our group, and I
felt the same way, but that doesn't mean that your contributions weren't extremely
beneficial to our project as a whole, especially in the home stretch when you
were a total wizard when it came to styling. I greatly appreciated your honesty throughout the project, and hope that you know how capable you are. Don't
underestimate and under sell your own abilities, you definitely know what you
are doing and it was such a pleasure working with you!

# Charolette

Valerie, it’s been really awesome having you on the Little Shop dream team. Thank you for coining that term for us. It’s clear from working with you that you have a really good understanding of what we’ve learned this mod. It was great pairing with you and working through issues we encountered in this project. I think, as we move forward you would benefit from writing tests before code. In mod 1 and at the beginning of this mod I was really resistant to TDD, but the more I embraced the process the easier it became to debug. I think some of the issues you encountered in this project could have been mitigated by this strategy. That said, I saw your testing improve a lot over this project. I think you have a strong conceptual and functional understanding of the MVC framework, and I think you’re really good at digging into issues. You were able to figure out some of the weirdest problems we ran into, for example embedding the link in the flash message. I enjoyed working with you, and I’m really happy with the application we built together.

# Courtney

Valerie, I really enjoyed working on the Little Shop project with you. I think your strengths were most obvious in the MVC structure and writing tests. You took on some of the most difficult features, such as the Admin-Orders dashboard. As a project member, I appreciate how you entertained everyone's ideas and asked questions that drove the development of our project. You were very communicative about what you were working on, and you consistently contributed high quality code to our application. In future projects, it might be helpful to advocate for what features you specifically want to work on to make sure that you're getting the learning experience you desire. Throughout Little Shop, you demonstrated tenacity and engagement in the development process. Your code reviews and questions asked during stand-ups made our code base stronger. I'm proud of the application we built together, and I look forward to working with you in the future.

### Gear Up

#### Trajedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL]
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

Takeaways
---------------------

    What did you learn?
      Discrimination in the work place exists; its not just an outdated idea that doesn't exists. Woman experience harassment in their workplace and as a women I need to be aware of that possibility when going into the work place.
    What did you already know?
      I knew sexism existed and that men dominated the tech industry. I knew that I had to be okay with the possibility that my future work place might have very few women in it or worse non. Knowing this I need to make sure I extend myself more so to other minority groups that feel isolated so that they might feel at home away from their comfort zone
    What surprised you the most?
      I was surprised to hear about the github case - that there was only one woman their and she wasn't treated fairly while she was there/leaving.
    What do you agree/disagree with?
      I agree that there needs to be a change in the tech community, and I think this will change as tech will lead us into the future.

  in the tech industry is a widely know phenomena and wasn't always present. It was intriguing to
  here real life examples of the consequences of such little numbers of woman in the tech. industry. I always understood
  that that would be an obstacle for me, my fellow woman, and other under represented groups, but to hear about it inside a
  company that I love is hard to hear and palpable. It's hard to hear, but necessary for change to occur. Woman were not always
  so under represented and in fact woman lead the innovations that we rely on today. It is important for for male and female to be
  cognizant of this gap and make an active effort to bridge it.

    1. How would you describe the "realities" of our future economy? What constraints and opportunities will we face as a nation?

    2. What's your reaction to hearing tech leaders like Elon Musk describe UBI as a "foregone conclusion"?

    3. Write a quick elevator pitch synthesizing what you've read from these articles: what is UBI, why is it entering policy debates, what do you think people should know about automation and its affect on our workforce?

    4. Do you think it's worthwhile to be educated about automation, its affect on our workforce, and policy solutions like UBI? What does it look like to be a responsible citizen in the face of such a large, inevitable transformation? Do you think you can really have an impact -- if not, why put energy into being informed?

*   Deliverables:


        I was the project manager for bike share, and during that project we used organization and open communication as guiding principles to keep us on track. To stay organized we used Waffle.io to keep track of all the needed tasks and to guide us daily on the work to be completed. We also communicated daily with checkin and stand ups at the beginning and end of group meetings or days where a good portion of work was done. Some things that didn't go well were git workflow, plan for what would happen when group members disagree, and using proper time management so that the project would be completed on time.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

# Brandon

  Brandon, I enjoyed working on bike share with you. We worked hard, and you really pulled us through the test portion of bike share. I see that you are a determined person; on the last night you showed that when you came back to work with us and it just showed me you really cared and were willing to stick it out. On future projects I would push for you to take on more. I think you underestimate yourself; you did a good job and you could gain a lot by diving in even if you don't feel comfortable. I look forward to working with you in future pairings.

# Alex

  Alex, you were great to work with on bike share. You worked as hard as I had hoped, you kept your cool during crunch time, and your easy to work with; having you on the team was a pleasure and I look forward to working together again. In future work, I think it would benefit you if you took on work that you are the least familiar with; although you did that a little bit with bike share, you should be conscious of it going in to a project. It was a pleasure working on a team with you; I'm very happy with the work we did.  

# G

  G, I love the personality that you bring to the table; its not just about work for you and that brings value to the team and I enjoyed having you as a team member. Although we didn't finish our bike share project you put in the effort and that is what is important. During our project we did have some down fall with the database; likely due to our lack of understanding. I'd say in the future to be cautious of what changes you are about to make only for the sake of trying to help someone. Perhaps, becoming more familiar with git and git workflow if you haven't already. Let it be noted that it is your spirit of helping others that got us into that predicament and at the end of the day that's the probably the best reason to have to go through so much trouble. You have a heart of gold and I love that about you.
# Casey

  Casey, your attitude is so positive and optimistic; it reminds me to be positive too; I'm so happy we were in a group together; you're a great person and a great team member. You actually were surprisingly on point even though we were away; it was as if you hadn't left. You also did a great job with striving to solve problems that I would have given up, think paperclip. I'm very proud of the work we did and I'm so happy to have worked with you. I hope we get to work together again in the future.

# Charolette

  Charolette, you're a great project manager, and a great team member; I really enjoyed having you as a teammate. Our project kicks ass I don't care how we score on it, and I can thank you and Courtney for that. You both were the back bone of the team, and I'm  unsure with out the both of you we would have done so well. This project felt the easiest to work through partly because it wasn't so difficult and partly because we all got along so well. Some food for thought: If ever in a project manager again and more so if you know the material decently; strive not exactly to get top scores on the project but to evenly divide the project responsibilities, and allow people room to struggle. Just for an example, I don't think I worked on a piece of the project by myself and instead of paired a lot with you. Albeit the testing part I asked for but then I never had a moment to struggle with a problem on my own. The only other piece of advice would be to be conscious of your driver/navigator habits; while we paired together everything went pretty smooth when I was driving and you were navigating; but when we switched you took on both navigator and driver. You're a great pairing partner to work with however; you kept a great attitude the whole time. I enjoyed that you took the time to celebrate the wins; it reminded me to lighten up and I really valued that. I hope I get the chance to work with you again.

# Courtney

Courtney, it was a pleasure to work with you; you are so thoughtful and considerate; and that's something I deeply admire about you. Our project kicks ass and you and Charolette held the team down the entire time. I love the focus and drive you have and they way that you can solve problems and break apart issues; I'm sure it will be something that serves you as you launch your career as a developer. I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate you caring and almost empathic character. I know you felt that I've had this internal struggle, and for you to take the time to care shows how great of a person you are. Keep that up, and keep up the drive and hunger to be better; you make me want to be a better - to-be - programmer. I always enjoy having you as a teammate; I hope we will continue to work together in the future.


### Being a Community Member

# Brandon

Hey Val!

I enjoyed working with you on Bikeshare. I was inspired by your willingness to spend extensive time on a project. You gave me a burst of energy to continue on our project when I would've usually tapped out at some time around 10pm. Your influence in a group project weighs heavily on the end results. You have an overall positive demenor and are very communicative. You were effective in delegating tasks, recognizing individual weaknesses and strengths and never portraid negativity under pressure. You were also never hesitant to give your input. Bottom line; I enjoy being aroud you. Thanks for the experience!

# Alex

Valerie,
It was great working with you on Bikeshare. I admired your work ethic and that you wanted to learn new concepts. You were always in a good mood which made working with you fun and relaxed. You also did a great job of laying the foundation for the styling of the project, and at a time when no one was really familiar with it. You were selected as the project manager and you should have done a better job of taking charge of the project and being the deciding voice to settle any decisions regarding the project. I enjoyed working with you, and I'm looking forward to pairing with you again.

# G

Valerie,

You are impressively determined, strong and so positive. Even in the hardest of time, you kept being enthusiastic and motivated us all to push through to finish as much as we could for our Bike Share project. I'm very happy that you were not afraid of voicing your opinions and visions from the moment the project started. It's very apparent how fascinated you are with programming and how much more you want to learn. I'm excited to see how far your passion will take you. It was a great pleasure working with you and I'm hoping we get paired again in the future!

# Casey

Valerie, it was so great working with you on this Little Shop. I hope you know what
a #GirlBoss you are, in general, but also when it comes to coding. I know that
you felt like your contributions weren't as much as others in our group, and I
felt the same way, but that doesn't mean that your contributions weren't extremely
beneficial to our project as a whole, especially in the home stretch when you
were a total wizard when it came to styling. I greatly appreciated your honesty throughout the project, and hope that you know how capable you are. Don't
underestimate and under sell your own abilities, you definitely know what you
are doing and it was such a pleasure working with you!

# Charolette

Valerie, it’s been really awesome having you on the Little Shop dream team. Thank you for coining that term for us. It’s clear from working with you that you have a really good understanding of what we’ve learned this mod. It was great pairing with you and working through issues we encountered in this project. I think, as we move forward you would benefit from writing tests before code. In mod 1 and at the beginning of this mod I was really resistant to TDD, but the more I embraced the process the easier it became to debug. I think some of the issues you encountered in this project could have been mitigated by this strategy. That said, I saw your testing improve a lot over this project. I think you have a strong conceptual and functional understanding of the MVC framework, and I think you’re really good at digging into issues. You were able to figure out some of the weirdest problems we ran into, for example embedding the link in the flash message. I enjoyed working with you, and I’m really happy with the application we built together.

# Courtney

Valerie, I really enjoyed working on the Little Shop project with you. I think your strengths were most obvious in the MVC structure and writing tests. You took on some of the most difficult features, such as the Admin-Orders dashboard. As a project member, I appreciate how you entertained everyone's ideas and asked questions that drove the development of our project. You were very communicative about what you were working on, and you consistently contributed high quality code to our application. In future projects, it might be helpful to advocate for what features you specifically want to work on to make sure that you're getting the learning experience you desire. Throughout Little Shop, you demonstrated tenacity and engagement in the development process. Your code reviews and questions asked during stand-ups made our code base stronger. I'm proud of the application we built together, and I look forward to working with you in the future.
