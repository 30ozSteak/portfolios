 Andrew Wooten - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
I came into this module as prepared as I thought I could be.  In progressing through this module
my goal is to gain a working knowledge and understanding of the concepts we are covering. I am
not presently seeking mastery, rather I'm working towards being in a place of technical knowledge
where I can find answers with reasonable ease and have to do so with a minimum frequency.

In terms of the greater Turing mission, I'm presently working hard to get settled in the Turing community.
I'm seeking to be a good team member to my fellow Module 1 students as well as communicate feedback
and ideas to staff.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)
Jungle Beats
* [GitHub URL]()
https://github.com/andrewdwooten/JungleBeats
* [Original Assignment]()
https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/jungle_beat

(description)
Built Node and LinkedList classes with goal of having machine speak
series of phrases on iterating through LinkedList.

(evaluation comments)
-long methods talked about refactoring and instance variables
-testing was 32 assertions all passing, testing was thorough
-classes need to be in separate files not all in one

(evaluation scores)

1. Functional Expectations
1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)
Enigma
* [GitHub URL]()
https://github.com/andrewdwooten/enigma
* [Original Assignment]()
https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown


(description)
Built program to encrypt, decrypt, and break messages including those stored in .txt files.

(evaluation comments)
27 tests, all passing
application encrypts, but does not decrypt or crack
some overuse of attr_accessor
File IO stuff could be broken out to separate class
some stuff in Enigma could be broken out to a separate class

(evaluation scores)

1. Overall Functionality
  1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but
   still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development
   3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, 
   but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components
  2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility
   are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

### Gear Up
GearUp Reflection: 12/2/16

Growth Mindset: Carol Dweck “The Power of Believing”.

	I enjoyed my first GearUp.  It was a good change from class time, and I was pleased to get exposed to personal development content.  I’d actually heard the TED talk by Carol Dweck before, but I hadn’t given it much thought or application to how I approached my life.  At the time, I was committed to a career, and I wasn’t in a mindset where I could see that my own fairly fixed mindset was causing harm to my life. Fast-forwarding to where I’m at in life presently, and I can definitely see how applicable a growth mindset is to not just professional success but personal also.
	I grew up in fairly competitive and pressured school environment; it was never unloving; however, there were high expectations set for grades/school/behavior/etc.  A ‘B’ was frowned upon.  I ended up carrying that mindset with me after high school, through college, and into my first career path.  While it gave me drive to succeed, it also had the unfortunate side effect of a myriad of negative feelings when I didn’t live up to my own fairly high expectations.  It hampered my ability to see progress I’d made in making it to a goal, and while I could power through it, it was at the expense of my own happiness.  It led me to a life where meeting goals was all that really mattered regardless of how I felt.
	At second pass, the growth mindset content meant a lot more to me at this point in my life; sometimes you have to be in a certain place for something to make sense I suppose.  I’ve found it’s application immediately helpful, and it’s among my focuses for school to maintain a growth mindset.  Looking back at the first week made me feel really good about life.  My growth mindset helped me focus on how much I’d already learned and accomplished rather than what I’d failed at throughout my time thus far.  It was very liberating, and I much prefer thinking that way to constantly having my attention on my failures and areas for progress.
	I enjoyed the group talks we had following the presentation.  I felt comfortable opening up, if only slightly, and was delighted to find that I wasn’t alone in how I felt about something, particularly in what caused me to slide into a fixed mindset.  The dialogue that took place within my group was immensely enjoyable.  It was productive and an excellent use of our time at Turing; I enjoyed getting to know my group members more closely.
	Overall, I was delighted at the content and surrounding experiences of my first GearUp.  I zealously look forward to the next.  

GearUp Reflection 12/16/16

Introversion/Extroversion Spectrum

	 I'm an introvert.  I guess my biggest takeway from this GearUp was that I'm not alone, a feeling most introverts are familiar with I imagine,
	 in that.  It hasn't been difficult for me to pinpoint myself on that spectrum over the course of my life to this point.  I'm looking at the
	 prompt questions: "What actions do you want to take for yourself and your cohort to be successful?", "How can you leverage your place on the
	 spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career?".  I think those are good questions, but I think ultimately the lesson should be
	 in regards to adaptability regardless of circumstance.  I say that because regardless of my position on the spectrum, my height, hair color,
	 (insert more arbitrary qualities) the world will continue to move forward.  Can a realistically expect for an employer to adapt an entire working
	 environment to me based on that fact that I fall pretty far left on that spectrum?  I cannot, therefore I must adapt.

	 I don't think of my introversion as a strength or a weakness, just a state of being which is, depending on situation, a hindrance and an asset.
	 I think the responsibility falls on the individual to know oneself intimately enough to safely navigate situations that the world puts before them.
	 As a function of my introversion, there is certainly a list of needs that need to be met in order to self-maintain: alone time to recharge, routine,
	 exercise, safe interaction with people, and even occasional deviations from all the above.  Some of those may be individual to me, but I'm aware of
	 them because they're my needs that I meet.  I know them forwards and backwards, and I can tell you based on how I am feeling which one has gone
	 unmet.  I would submit that in taking care of myself that I'm self-enabling to put out the best of me into the world, workplace, school, whathaveyou.

	 It sounds simple doesn't it?  Make a list, check items off the list, and everything is okay.  I submit that the best any person can do is to arrange
	 ones life such that their baseline needs are seen to.  From there, engage a constant battle to push the envelope farther and harder lest they end 
	 up sendentary, which isn't a good thing for anyone. If you first master yourself, then you are best equipped to affect whatever change you see fit
	 in the world.  I learned not that much during GearUp; that's not to degrade the content, which was excellent.  It was a good reminder to remain self-
	 conscious in the best way possible.  My largest takeaways were growing closer to my fellow 1611 backenders.  I was happy to sit in my small group and
	 share experiences, challenges faced, and solutions come to.  I was thankful for that time.
