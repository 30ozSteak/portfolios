 Andrew Wooten - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
I came into this module as prepared as I thought I could be.  In progressing through this module
my goal is to gain a working knowledge and understanding of the concepts we are covering. I am
not presently seeking mastery, rather I'm working towards being in a place of technical knowledge
where I can find answers with reasonable ease and have to do so with a minimum frequency.

In terms of the greater Turing mission, I'm presently working hard to get settled in the Turing community.
I'm seeking to be a good team member to my fellow Module 1 students as well as communicate feedback
and ideas to staff.

(description)
Built Node and LinkedList classes with goal of having machine speak
series of phrases on iterating through LinkedList.

(evaluation comments)
-long methods talked about refactoring and instance variables
-testing was 32 assertions all passing, testing was thorough
-classes need to be in separate files not all in one

(evaluation scores)
1. Functional Expectations
1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

(feedback to me)
In addition to the above evaluation comments and scoring Ilana complimented my working
in the areas of testing and use of loops.  I was encouraged to maintain and improve the quality
of my tests.  My areas identified for improvement include making my methods more succinct,
utilizing variables appropriately, and organization of files.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
GearUp Reflection: 12/2/16

Growth Mindset: Carol Dweck “The Power of Believing”.

	I enjoyed my first GearUp.  It was a good change from class time, and I was pleased to get exposed to personal development content.  I’d actually heard the TED talk by Carol Dweck before, but I hadn’t given it much thought or application to how I approached my life.  At the time, I was committed to a career, and I wasn’t in a mindset where I could see that my own fairly fixed mindset was causing harm to my life. Fast-forwarding to where I’m at in life presently, and I can definitely see how applicable a growth mindset is to not just professional success but personal also.
	I grew up in fairly competitive and pressured school environment; it was never unloving; however, there were high expectations set for grades/school/behavior/etc.  A ‘B’ was frowned upon.  I ended up carrying that mindset with me after high school, through college, and into my first career path.  While it gave me drive to succeed, it also had the unfortunate side effect of a myriad of negative feelings when I didn’t live up to my own fairly high expectations.  It hampered my ability to see progress I’d made in making it to a goal, and while I could power through it, it was at the expense of my own happiness.  It led me to a life where meeting goals was all that really mattered regardless of how I felt.
	At second pass, the growth mindset content meant a lot more to me at this point in my life; sometimes you have to be in a certain place for something to make sense I suppose.  I’ve found it’s application immediately helpful, and it’s among my focuses for school to maintain a growth mindset.  Looking back at the first week made me feel really good about life.  My growth mindset helped me focus on how much I’d already learned and accomplished rather than what I’d failed at throughout my time thus far.  It was very liberating, and I much prefer thinking that way to constantly having my attention on my failures and areas for progress.
	I enjoyed the group talks we had following the presentation.  I felt comfortable opening up, if only slightly, and was delighted to find that I wasn’t alone in how I felt about something, particularly in what caused me to slide into a fixed mindset.  The dialogue that took place within my group was immensely enjoyable.  It was productive and an excellent use of our time at Turing; I enjoyed getting to know my group members more closely.
	Overall, I was delighted at the content and surrounding experiences of my first GearUp.  I zealously look forward to the next.
