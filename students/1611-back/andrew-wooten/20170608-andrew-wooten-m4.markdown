Description:
  Will Legislate For Money is a Python/Django app built as a tool to give
  voters easier access to information on their legislatorsâ€™ campaign funding
  and congressional action. It includes integration of Twitter log-in via
  django-social-auth. The user is able to browse legislators, view a
  summary/visualization of a legislators campaign contributions by industry and
  organization, and view bills currently sponsored by the legislator. The user
  is able to 'follow' legislators of interest and have them appear on their
  user page. From the user page, a user is able to view the Twitter feed of any
  legislator that they are currently following.

  My areas of focus for this project included integration of the Twitter
  log-in, establishing a database relationship between legislators/user, and
  adding the ability for a user to view a legislators Twitter feed from the
  user profile page. Additionally, I utilized the aXe Chrome extension to
  identify and resolve many accessibility issues that existed from the previous
  version of the project.
