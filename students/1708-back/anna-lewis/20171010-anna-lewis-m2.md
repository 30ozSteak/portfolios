## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

This module, I mainly wanted to learn about and really understand how the internet works and how rails allows us to build applications with Ruby code that can be rendered in the browser. I also wanted to build relationships with module one students because I enjoy helping others and learn best when describing something to someone else. I would say that I still feel that the world wide web is largely a mystery to me, but at least now I have this understanding of how requests and responses and how information is passed between client and server. I do feel like I have had the chance to help several module one students and I hope that I can continue to do so in the future.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I think my most pressing struggle was one that has been fairly cyclic for me, and that is managing my depression and anxiety in a way that I am able to have stumbles and get right back up and running. Overall, each time I experience one of these cycles, I think I manage to learn from it and improve. This time around, I learned that if I have to miss a day, it is beneficial for me to force myself to work in a public space such as a coffee shop or library in order to not completely withdraw. Getting out of the house and accomplishing even a small task allows me to more confidently attend class the next day and prevent a snowballing effect.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects this module were bike_share and the rails_mini_project. I liked bike_share because it was both my first time coding in a group larger than two people and also because it was my first time actually putting something in my browser (the 'hello, world' one I made previously doesn't count). I really enjoyed learning about project managment tools and better use of Pull Requests. It was something that I hadn't looked into much, but being in a larger group meant that I saw the impact these tools could have. I also really enjoyed the rails_mini_project because I got to go outside my comfort zone and try to make my own guidelines for a project. I find that I do well with user stories, but I want to work on my ability to propose ideas and think about what makes a good application. I really struggled with this project, but I would aslo argue that it is the project that I learned the most from: both because of implementing my own ideas and because I tried to focus on TDD. I also got to learn a lot about custom routes and it was cool to see exactly how I can move around a webpage.

My least favorite project was probably job_tracker, through no fault of its own. Since companies and part of jobs were already setup, I let myself do a lot of referencing from these. I think I might have learned more if I had forced myself to avoid looking at the code for these. I also waited until the end of the project to write tests, mostly because we were still in the process of learning about testing(or at least that's how I rationalized it to myself). This resulted in me hardly understanding error messages in my terminal and doing most of my debugging in the console provided when a page is unable to render. This was all very evident in my mid-mod assessment.
