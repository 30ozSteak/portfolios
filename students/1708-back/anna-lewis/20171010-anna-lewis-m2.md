## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects this module were bike_share and the rails_mini_project. I liked bike_share because it was both my first time coding in a group larger than two people and also because it was my first time actually putting something in my browser (the 'hello, world' one I made previously doesn't count). I really enjoyed learning about project managment tools and better use of Pull Requests. It was something that I hadn't looked into much, but being in a larger group meant that I saw the impact these tools could have. I also really enjoyed the rails_mini_project because I got to go outside my comfort zone and try to make my own guidelines for a project. I find that I do well with user stories, but I want to work on my ability to propose ideas and think about what makes a good application. I really struggled with this project, but I would aslo argue that it is the project that I learned the most from: both because of implementing my own ideas and because I tried to focus on TDD. I also got to learn a lot about custom routes and it was cool to see exactly how I can move around a webpage.

My least favorite project was probably job_tracker, through no fault of its own. Since companies and part of jobs were already setup, I let myself do a lot of referencing from these. I think I might have learned more if I had forced myself to avoid looking at the code for these. I also waited until the end of the project to write tests, mostly because we were still in the process of learning about testing(or at least that's how I rationalized it to myself). This resulted in me hardly understanding error messages in my terminal and doing most of my debugging in the console provided when a page is unable to render. This was all very eveident in my mid-mod assessment.
