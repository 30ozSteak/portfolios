## Areas of Emphasis

This module emphasized working on a brownfield project, which taught me a lot about managing expectations, sifting through old code, and the art of refactoring. Towards the end of this module I began focusing on learning Python and building simple applications with it.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Self-Directed

I spent the final two weeks of the module working on learning Python. Although I did not meet all of my learning goals, I learned a lot about Python and Flask, and made good progress on a rather complicated tutorial.

  Feedback To Jean Joeris: Jean has been an exceptional team leader. While he seemed a little unsure of his role at the beginning of the project, he certainly made up for that by the end. He became more engaged in the project and with working with fellow team members, and he did excellent work on the search feature. Jean has an innate talent for managing the expectations of others in a fruitful and compassionate way. It was truly a pleasure to be on a team with him.

  Feedback to Raphael Barbo: I think Rapha and I would both agree that we've learned a lot from each other about our own working and communication styles. He is the consummate professional, and I appreciate that he has been receptive to feedback. He brings a gentle positivity to every endeavor, and has put in a lot of effort on this project. I'm glad to know him, and have learned a lot about how I can improve myself not only as a programmer, but as a human.

  Feedback to Brian Heim: Brian has been the person I worked with most on this project, and every moment was truly a pleasure. Even when we were frustrated, I always felt we were in it together. I had never worked with Brian before this project, and I am truly lucky to now have had the opportunity to do so. Brian has patience, resilience, and an incredibly upbeat personality. He allowed me to explore potential solutions even if they didn't work, and he never talked down to me. He treated me as an equal, and was incredibly respectful and compassionate. I learned from him how to have a sense of humor about our frustrations, and he kept me optimistic even when I felt downtrodden. I'm really grateful to Brian for his kindness and camaraderie. It means more than I can say. :)

  Feedback to David Davydov: David and I have worked together before, and it was a pleasure to work with him again on exposing the API endpoint. David is methodical and enthusiastic about coding. He was patient and respectful, and I appreciate his considerable skill. David has become an incredibly strong developer during his time at Turing, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to learn with him.
