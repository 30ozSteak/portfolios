### Deliverables
#### Flower Exercise Follow-Up Paragraphs

###### 1-2 paragraphs describing your perceived barriers and the action steps you will take to overcome them

> I often time hesitate to apply for jobs because of the qualifications required, and one of the biggest changes I have noticed on myself is that I am looking at them from a different perspective. "Yeah I am not have all the qualifications, but I sure as heck can learn anything", and that has opened up some doors and interviews recently.

###### 1 paragraph describing my top 3 priorities in my first dev job and why

> I think as far as my first job goes, one of my top priorities is definitely the size of the company that I will be working for. Iâ€™ve worked at companies that were smaller and although I appreciated the experience I've learned that is not quite my thing. As a junior developer I am looking for mentorship above anything else.My second priority is definitely staying in Colorado, my wife and I moved here December 2015 and I since she was born and raise in Boulder, we would like to stay around the area (or should I say it is not an option to move anywhere else). Last but def not least important is benefits over salary, I would much rather work for a company with great benefits rather than getting paid big bucks (of course I know what I am worth) but still benefits are important for me since I am planning on having a family sometime next year.

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscious

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This gear up was fun because we got to read a couple of articles that made me think and reevaluate how I feel about voting or not voting during an election. The discussions were short, but that made them have to be pertinent, in order to get our points across. It was a good gear up.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This gear up was great because we were able to have it within our own cohort. We talked about introverts and extroverts and I learned more about a couple of introverts in my class, and realized how working in groups was a much much different experience for them, than it was for me. I made me rethink how I should treat and accept people during group work, because of the way they might be feeling about it, if they are an introvert.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This gear up really solidified a term that I never really related to my life. In my life I have been very resilient, but I never knew that's what it was. Now, I know what it is, and me and my group talked about techniques to be more resilient in my every day life.
