### Areas of Emphasis

I think it is undeniable that my main area of emphasis for module 4 is to prove to myself that I can do this... I love coding and I love the challenges it represents, and although I do not want to be a software developer for the rest of my life (I really want to be a Product/Project Manager), I now have a great sense of admiration for coding and coders. My goal for module four as far as technical skills, was definitely to get as much exposure as possible to JS and REACTJS, and I think I have accomplished it thanks to the curriculum that the staff has put together.

### A: End of Module Assessment

_FEEDBACK NOTES_

- Missing partial functionality from 4 and 5
- Missing any testing for create and edit link. Expecting controller tests.
- Javascript is kind of verbose, but it shows troubleshooting and problem solving
- ^^^ The above things have been addressed and corrected 

_EVAL NOTES_

### 1. Satisfactory Progress
* **3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style
* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 4. Testing
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

### 5. User Interface
* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

### 6. Workflow
* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Open Source (with Jesse)

We collaborated to Lovisa's CREACT Tutorial. It was not only fun to do it, but the great feedback we received from her, and I am looking forward to keep collaborating to the tutorial as we receive more and more feedback.

### Enroll

* [Enroll GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/enroll)
* [Enroll Staging](http://enroll-staging.turing.io)
* [Apply Staging](http://apply-staging.turing.io/)

### Capstone Project

This was a six weeks long project, our cohort was split up into three teams with different projects, two of which were meant to communicate with each other. I personally worked on the Enroll team, which was an active enrollment app for Turing students. We were asked to implement new features as well as modify current functionalities so that it could integrate with its sister project aka Census.

The main features I have made contributions are `Smart Search`, `Testing Suites`, and last but not list the initial communication between Enroll and Census.  

### Enroll

`Enroll` is an enrollment app for new students. They must register through `Apply`, an authentication service, before gaining access to Enroll. Future iterations will have Enroll speak to Census to do the authentication side of it (instead of Apply).

_FEEDBACK NOTES_

I'll just ramble for a while. I've decided that you were given some above average difficulty, but not impossible tasks. Everyone complains about Josh Cheek's code, but I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility of things you'll find, especially in the open source world. I've found that gems and libraries are written by people that are just coding all the time, and they need to keep themselves interested.

The real struggle that I stepped into was process. Our goal was to simulate how projects are really done in the working world, and your process was holding you back. Communication between the different roles on the team, staff and student, was broken. People didn't know what others were thinking, how to get their questions across, or how to communicate progress and blockers. I can't say who's fault that is, but I'm big on personal responsibility, so I'll just say it was everyone's fault.

There are actually still improvements to be made to our communication and workflow. With all that said, I went back into manager mode, and I was strict about deliverables and adherence to the workflow I've communicated, and you guys bounced back quickly. I want you to ramp up even more in the last two weeks of the project, but I'm proud of what you delivered this week and how you delivered it. You're making lasting impact on your own careers, and the cogs that make Turing run.

_PEERS FEEDBACK_

**From Sonia** Feedback to Raphael Barbo: I think Rapha and I would both agree that we've learned a lot from each other about our own working and communication styles. He is the consummate professional, and I appreciate that he has been receptive to feedback. He brings a gentle positivity to every endeavor, and has put in a lot of effort on this project. I'm glad to know him, and have learned a lot about how I can improve myself not only as a programmer, but as a human.


**From Brian H.** I have worked with Rapha before and it is always great to work with him. He and I work well together and contribute code harmoniously when we pair. Unfortunately I only got to work with Rapha for one afternoon on this project, but it was on a cool feature: the smart search, and was very rewarding. Rapha is a strong coder and has a relentless motor; he is always hungry for more code and new things to try. I look forward to seeing what he can accomplish after we leave Turing.


**From Jean** Feedback for Raphael Barbo: Rapha is wonderful to work with. When pairing he is happy to let people try a solution, but has no problem questioning the solution. His happy, laid back attitude makes it easy to pair with him, even in stressful situations. He essential to creating smart search, and continued to work on it with David on a day I had to leave. This is my second project working with Rapha, and both times he has been an excellent team member

**From David** Raphael has matured a lot during his time at Turing, particularly in the way he approaches a group project. Not only is he a very dependable and hard working programmer, he is also light and keeps things fun. I can honestly say that it has always been a blast to work with you Raphael. You are the kind of guy I'd like to work with in the real world.

## D: Professional Skills

### Deliverables
#### Flower Exercise Follow-Up Paragraphs

###### 1-2 paragraphs describing your perceived barriers and the action steps you will take to overcome them

> I often time hesitate to apply for jobs because of the qualifications required, and one of the biggest changes I have noticed on myself is that I am looking at them from a different perspective. "Yeah I am not have all the qualifications, but I sure as heck can learn anything", and that has opened up some doors and interviews recently.

###### 1 paragraph describing my top 3 priorities in my first dev job and why

> I think as far as my first job goes, one of my top priorities is definitely the size of the company that I will be working for. Iâ€™ve worked at companies that were smaller and although I appreciated the experience I've learned that is not quite my thing. As a junior developer I am looking for mentorship above anything else.My second priority is definitely staying in Colorado, my wife and I moved here December 2015 and I since she was born and raise in Boulder, we would like to stay around the area (or should I say it is not an option to move anywhere else). Last but def not least important is benefits over salary, I would much rather work for a company with great benefits rather than getting paid big bucks (of course I know what I am worth) but still benefits are important for me since I am planning on having a family sometime next year.

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscious

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This gear up was fun because we got to read a couple of articles that made me think and reevaluate how I feel about voting or not voting during an election. The discussions were short, but that made them have to be pertinent, in order to get our points across. It was a good gear up.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This gear up was great because we were able to have it within our own cohort. We talked about introverts and extroverts and I learned more about a couple of introverts in my class, and realized how working in groups was a much much different experience for them, than it was for me. I made me rethink how I should treat and accept people during group work, because of the way they might be feeling about it, if they are an introvert.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This gear up really solidified a term that I never really related to my life. In my life I have been very resilient, but I never knew that's what it was. Now, I know what it is, and me and my group talked about techniques to be more resilient in my every day life.
