### A: End of Module Assessment

Notes:

* Missing Hot & Top functionality
* No search filter
* errors when trying to mark as read and as a result nothing getting to hot reads

* really great testing on all levels

* JavaScript
  * Suggest naming functions for the binding of events and such.
  * Try to use robust selectors instead of `parents()`, `find()` and `closest()`


FIXED FUNCTIONALITY AND PROGRESS WAS UPDATED TO 3

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 4: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with no bugs and has one or more supporting feature implemented.
* __3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.__
* 2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* __4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* __3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

### 4. Testing

* __4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.__
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they're written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

### 5. User Interface

* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* __3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality__
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

### 6. Workflow

* __4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.__
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1: The developer commited the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.

### Deliverables
#### Flower Exercise Follow-Up Paragraphs

###### 1-2 paragraphs describing your perceived barriers and the action steps you will take to overcome them

> I’ve always had the habit of talking myself out of feeling qualified for certain jobs if I didn’t meet most of the requirements for a job listing. Even so called “entry level” jobs would often ask for a few years of experience in a certain position, so it always felt unattainable to get the jobs I felt like I was actually qualified for. Moving forward, I know that I have skills to learn quickly at a new job and will not let certain job requirements keep me from applying to a job. Even if a job listing mentions something I do not know, I will express to my potential employers (and myself) how I will learn and adapt quickly to make myself a valuable asset to the dev team and the company as a whole.

###### 1 paragraph describing my top 3 priorities in my first dev job and why

> For my first job post-Turing, one of my top priorities is the size of the company I work for. In the past, I’ve worked at a few companies that were at most 10 people--usually around seven people. While I’m happy for the experience I learned at these startups, working at a company around 20-40 people in size would offer more an established feel for me as a junior developer. Location is the next important thing for me--I’d ideally like to stay in Colorado for the next few years since my family just moved back here to be close to me. My last top priority would be a benefits package that includes decent health insurance. Being 25 now, I only have one more year before I’m kicked off of my family’s plan, so having that would be key for me.

### The Plan

* [Link to Gist](https://gist.github.com/j-sm-n/bebd8d76604a152d7f6d0709ee873509)
___

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscious

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This gear up was fun because we got to read a couple of articles that made me think and reevaluate how I feel about voting or not voting during an election. The discussions were short, but that made them have to be pertinent, in order to get our points across. It was a good gear up.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This gear up was great because we were able to have it within our own cohort. We talked about introverts and extroverts and I learned more about a couple of introverts in my class, and realized how working in groups was a much much different experience for them, than it was for me. I made me rethink how I should treat and accept people during group work, because of the way they might be feeling about it, if they are an introvert.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This gear up really solidified a term that I never really related to my life. In my life I have been very resilient, but I never knew that's what it was. Now, I know what it is, and me and my group talked about techniques to be more resilient in my every day life.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Golick Posse

- This module, we really focused on technical prep and I took away some great knowledge for the real world. I'm also really excited to be the head posse lead next module, and I plan on giving Golick a little revamp to get people excited about it again.
