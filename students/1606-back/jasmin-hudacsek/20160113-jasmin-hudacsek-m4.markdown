### Deliverables
#### Flower Exercise Follow-Up Paragraphs

###### 1-2 paragraphs describing your perceived barriers and the action steps you will take to overcome them

> I’ve always had the habit of talking myself out of feeling qualified for certain jobs if I didn’t meet most of the requirements for a job listing. Even so called “entry level” jobs would often ask for a few years of experience in a certain position, so it always felt unattainable to get the jobs I felt like I was actually qualified for. Moving forward, I know that I have skills to learn quickly at a new job and will not let certain job requirements keep me from applying to a job. Even if a job listing mentions something I do not know, I will express to my potential employers (and myself) how I will learn and adapt quickly to make myself a valuable asset to the dev team and the company as a whole.

###### 1 paragraph describing my top 3 priorities in my first dev job and why

> For my first job post-Turing, one of my top priorities is the size of the company I work for. In the past, I’ve worked at a few companies that were at most 10 people--usually around seven people. While I’m happy for the experience I learned at these startups, working at a company around 20-40 people in size would offer more an established feel for me as a junior developer. Location is the next important thing for me--I’d ideally like to stay in Colorado for the next few years since my family just moved back here to be close to me. My last top priority would be a benefits package that includes decent health insurance. Being 25 now, I only have one more year before I’m kicked off of my family’s plan, so having that would be key for me.

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscious

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This gear up was fun because we got to read a couple of articles that made me think and reevaluate how I feel about voting or not voting during an election. The discussions were short, but that made them have to be pertinent, in order to get our points across. It was a good gear up.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This gear up was great because we were able to have it within our own cohort. We talked about introverts and extroverts and I learned more about a couple of introverts in my class, and realized how working in groups was a much much different experience for them, than it was for me. I made me rethink how I should treat and accept people during group work, because of the way they might be feeling about it, if they are an introvert.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This gear up really solidified a term that I never really related to my life. In my life I have been very resilient, but I never knew that's what it was. Now, I know what it is, and me and my group talked about techniques to be more resilient in my every day life.

### Golick Posse

- This module, we really focused on technical prep and I took away some great knowledge for the real world. I'm also really excited to be the head posse lead next module, and I plan on giving Golick a little revamp to get people excited about it again.
