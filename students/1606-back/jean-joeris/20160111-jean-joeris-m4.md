### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

### End of Module Assessment

Notes:

- Hot reads is ranking by link record on the main app instead of by URL
- Funky but good. Shows a lot of learning and progress just in this final.

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* **3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 4. Testing

* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

### 5. User Interface

* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

### 6. Workflow

* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**

### Work

#### Self-directed Learning

The only individual project I did this mod was self-directed learning of Elixir & Phoenix.
These were the learning goals I defined at the beginning of the final 2 week sprint:

#### By 1/5
  * Build a basic hello world app in Phoenix
      * [Deliverable](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/phoenix_blog_example)
  
#### By 1/9
  * Write a blog post
      * Compare/contrast rails and phoenix
      * [Deliverable](https://medium.com/@jeanjoeris/a-rails-devs-perspective-on-learning-phoenix-bcbab7b2545a#.328sawgvv)

#### By 1/12
  * Create a phoenix app to duplicate enroll api endpoint used by dashboard
      * Hook up to same database, duplicate exposed data
      * [Deliverable](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/phoenix_enroll)
      
#### Stretch goals
  * Explore trying to leverage the parallelization and/or failure behavior of Elixir
      * Not sure what this would look like
  * Rebuild ideabox with phoenix and react
  
Of these goals, I was able to meet the meet the first two. The third one is in progress. I have a Phoenix app that communicates to Enroll's postgres database and have built a few Phoenix models using this db. I have worked through a tutorial on building a json api in Phoenix. The only reason I haven't built the Enroll endpoint is that it requires serious use of the Phoenix ORM (Ecto). I could try to hack it together using raw sql, but 
  1. the json is complicated enough I'm not sure this would work, and more importantly
  2. I was to actually learn how to use Ecto
I am happy to try and deliver this controller some time next week.

The stretch goals were not achieved, but I have made progress towards them. The Phoenix book I am working through is building a project that uses the concurrency capabilities of Phoenix. I also have a fun idea for a React/Phoenix project to build - see Phoenix Paint in Side Hussle under The Plan.

#### Open Source Contribution
I paired with Dan Broadbent for working on open source. We decided to contribute to Ruby For Good's project helping Habitat for Humanity New Orleans

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/the-plan/assignments/open-source)
* Pull requests
  * [My PR for fixing the sizes of images displayed in the app](https://github.com/rubyforgood/habitat_humanity/pull/118)
  * [Dan's PR for adding names to a table reporting shifts](https://github.com/rubyforgood/habitat_humanity/pull/119)
  * [Our PR for adding documentation on node.js, and install Postgres in Linux & Windows](https://github.com/rubyforgood/habitat_humanity/pull/120)
  
This project was not evaluated, but we did meet all the requirements layed out in the original assignment. The main take away Dan and I had was that we shouldn't measure the size of a contribution to a project by the ease/difficulty we had making it, but by the value it adds to the project. Our small changes made the shift reporting much more usable, helping an organization we want to support.

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Sonia Gupta: Sonia has been an excellent team member. She took on the  DevOps and rocked it. When unexpected deployment issues came up she was ready to address, even when she had other work to do. Her willingness to give me frank and direct feedback about my product management was extremely helpful. She was also collaborated well with Matt on Dashboard. I'm very glad I got to work with Sonia

Feedback for David Davydov: David was an excellent team member. Early on in the project he was key in fixing the test suite. He did great work on dashboard and exposing enroll data to the dashboard. I wish I had worked with him during this time.  I did get to work with him on the search features. He did an excellent job pushing for refactoring until the logic was more polished. He was a team player willing to take on a variety of cards. He was a pleasure to work with.

Feedback for Brian Heim: Brian was a great team member. He worked with Sonia very hard on DevOps and handling our deployment, which was harder than anyone expected. Issues kept coming up, yet he was willing to continue troubleshooting as long as needed. I regret I didn't get to work with him more often on this project, as I know from Mind on The Ball we work excellent together. He was very hard working throughout and I'm glad he was on Enroll.

Feedback for Raphael Barbo: Rapha is wonderful to work with. When pairing he is happy to let people try a solution, but has no problem questioning the solution. His happy, laid back attitude makes it easy to pair with him, even in stressful situations. He essential to creating smart search, and continued to work on it with David on a day I had to leave. This is my second project working with Rapha, and both times he has been an excellent team member.

### Being a Community Member

From Mike Schutte - Jean has incredibly contagious enthusiasm for learning. Whereas many can become obsessed with technical knowledge in a way that builds barriers between them and others, Jean makes his passions approachable and welcoming to all who care to listen. In my few but meaningful interactions with Jean, it is clear that he lives a life full of intention and empathy, and Iâ€™m grateful for his initiative in the Turing community to show us more of what the wonderful world of programming has to offer.


### Playing a Part

I supported the Turing community by running Armstrong Posse. I regularly lead spikes on a variety of topics including:
  * Linear regression
  * Neural nets
  * Deep Learning
  * Functional programming with Elixir
I also try to make myself available to people for pairing and help when I'm hanging out in the big workspace. I also gave a lightning talk on the status of the EM drive, as I believe staying abreast of science is important to programmers (and I like talking about physics).
