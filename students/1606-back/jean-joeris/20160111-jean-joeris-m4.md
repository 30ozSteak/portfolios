### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

### End of Module Assessment

Notes:

- Hot reads is ranking by link record on the main app instead of by URL
- Funky but good. Shows a lot of learning and progress just in this final.

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* **3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 4. Testing

* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

### 5. User Interface

* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

### 6. Workflow

* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**

### Work

The only individual project I did this mod was self-directed learning of Elixir & Phoenix.

#### Self-directed Learning

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/enroll)
* [Original Assignment](http://enroll-staging.turing.io/)

These were the learning goals I defined at the beginning of the final 2 week sprint:

#### By 1/5
  * Build a basic hello world app in Phoenix
      * [Deliverable](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/phoenix_blog_example)
  
#### By 1/9
  * Write a blog post
      * Compare/contrast rails and phoenix
      * [Deliverable](https://medium.com/@jeanjoeris/a-rails-devs-perspective-on-learning-phoenix-bcbab7b2545a#.328sawgvv)

#### By 1/12
  * Create a phoenix app to duplicate enroll api endpoint used by dashboard
      * Hook up to same database, duplicate exposed data
      * [Deliverable](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/phoenix_enroll)
      
#### Stretch goals
  * Explore trying to leverage the parallelization and/or failure behavior of Elixir
      * Not sure what this would look like
  * Rebuild ideabox with phoenix and react
  
Of these goals, I was able to meet the meet the first two. The third one is in progress. I have a Phoenix app that communicates to Enroll's postgres database and have built a few Phoenix models using this db. I have worked through a tutorial on building a json api in Phoenix. The only reason I haven't built the Enroll endpoint is that it requires serious use of the Phoenix ORM (Ecto). I could try to hack it together using raw sql, but 
  a) the json is complicated enough I'm not sure this would work, and
  b) I was to actually learn how to use Ecto
I am happy to try and deliver this controller some time next week.

The stretch goals were not achieved, but I have made progress towards them. The Phoenix book I am working through is building a project that uses the concurrency capabilities of Phoenix. I also have a fun idea for a React/Phoenix project to build - see Phoenix Paint in Side Hussle under The Plan.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

From Mike Schutte - Jean has incredibly contagious enthusiasm for learning. Whereas many can become obsessed with technical knowledge in a way that builds barriers between them and others, Jean makes his passions approachable and welcoming to all who care to listen. In my few but meaningful interactions with Jean, it is clear that he lives a life full of intention and empathy, and Iâ€™m grateful for his initiative in the Turing community to show us more of what the wonderful world of programming has to offer.

### Playing a Part

I supported the Turing community by running Armstrong Posse. I regularly lead spikes on a variety of topics including:
  * Linear regression
  * Neural nets
  * Deep Learning
  * Functional programming with Elixir
I also try to make myself available to people for pairing and help when I'm hanging out in the big workspace. I also gave a lightning talk on the status of the EM drive, as I believe staying abreast of science is important to programmers (and I like talking about physics).
