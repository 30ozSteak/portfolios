# Susi Irwin - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This module my main goal is to further prepare myself for my new career in software development. I want to use Agile to develop the project to which I have been assigned. I want to be a contributing member of the class, the team, and the Community. I was to learn JavaScript and jQuery well enough to feel comfortable with the vocabulary to continue my learning post-Turing. I want to graduate Turing.

#### Personal Experience:
This project has been pretty amazing overall. We were given a brownfield project with not a ton of functionality built in and basically a brainstormed list of what Jeff would like to see in the application by the end of the 6 weeks. We also, as a team, brainstormed some of our own ideas for features that we, as users of the system, thought would be awesome to have included. We were to use Agile methodologies to progress through three, 2 week sprints with Andrew as our Scrum Master/Tech Lead. I have used Agile and been a part of scrums and sprints in my previous career, but not as a developer, so I was really excited to see how that side of the desk would be. It was more frustrating than I anticipated, but I think that was due to a few specific factors:

* Lack of clear directives about the sprint as a whole
* Miscommunication about what sprint planning and card assignments

Our application is a Company and Job finding and reviewing application. We were originally tasked with using the data from a PDF of over 2500 companies to basically seed the database. As we got into the first sprint and saw the content that was included, we started questioning the effectiveness of including that data. Eventually, the team created 12 examples of the types of companies and information we would like to see in the application. This POC, along with a meeting with Lia to discuss our thoughts with her, was enough to show the Tech Leads why we felt the way we did. The app is up and running and includes those 12 companies. The app is basically crowd-sourced; students will log in and begin populating the database with companies and contact information. Any logged in user can add notes to a company page. Users can star companies and save them to their own profile as well. Our service in this app is a previously worked on Scale Up project called "Looking For" that allows students and alumni to search job postings. The overall goal our team has in mind (for future modules) is that Monocle is a one stop shop for Job Hunting resources and tracking.

I think one of the biggest hurdles we faced as a team was understanding the expectations set on us each sprint. My understanding of Sprint Planning has always been that cards are created and assigned during Sprint planning and those cards are to be completed within the sprint timeframe - in our case, 2 weeks. There were a few times where this was not what was asked of us and that made things confusing. Also, I was more used to demo-ing at the end of a sprint and not twice - once being in the middle, the second at the end.

That being said, there was a lot of AWESOME that happened within out project. I noticed that we mainly paired on tasks since the bulk of our sprints 2 and 3 were JavaScript focused and all 4 of us were pretty new to the language. We came in on weekends, talked via Github and Slack, and really made the effort to communicate tasks and progress. As a team, we never really stormed, which was pretty great, and when we were "performing", we were really moving along. The team stayed focused and realistic about abilities, timeframes, and deliverables as best as we could.

The main part of the project that I am proud of and excited about is the JavaScript Notes for companies. This was a long, very long, tedious set of cards for Dan and me. This took us more than 1 sprint to accomplish (it was all due for Sprint 2), but we hit a lot of snags - mainly the fact that we had a few lessons in JavaScript and were trying to implement it as we went. I know that this was probably one of the more realistic "real world" scenarios for us in this project so although it was frustrating, it was also pretty amazing. We knew that our code left a lot to be desired, but we had no idea how buggy it truly was until we started messing with it in staging and production. It was an eye opener for us. We had to sit down, go back through all of the JavaScript we had written and really just dig our teeth into it to see what was going on, where it was breaking, and what we needed to do to fix it. And... we got it. Such an amazing feeling! Our ajax calls were firing, we were persisting data to the database, we could show a note's author and allow a note owner (or admin) to edit and delete notes. In Rails this was a no brainer for us - we had it working in no time, but JS was a different story and it was a difficult one. It feels really good to squash those bugs.

#### Feedback to me:


#### Feedback from me:
Nate Anderson: "Nate, your analytical nature makes you such a pleasure to work with on projects and specifically on Monocle. You are not afraid to ask the tough questions of the Tech Lead, the Team, or the application itself."

Brendan Dillon: "It has been such an amazing pleasure to get to work with you on this project. Your ability to look at a problem, break it down into super small, reasonable parts is second to none. I am in awe at your abilities with JavaScript and jQuery. No card given to you ever seemed to fluster you in the slightest. I hope to gain some of your confidence and curiosity as I move away from Turing. Your calm approach to programming verges on Zen and is extremely commendable."

Dan Broadbent: "You stepped up on day 1 and offered to PM the project. Kudos to you for that! I admire your ability to stand up for your opinions to the tech leads and present the facts as you seem them, back them up with evidence and present your case. You never get emotional about it, you simply state what you know, what you see, and your proposed outcome. You have amazing communication skills both written and spoken. You present yourself in a professional manner but still know how to sit back and joke around when the timing is right. Pairing with you on the Notes section of the project was great. Thank you for trusting me to struggle through some bugs and knowing when to step in and offer guidance and support. You are a natural leader and it was great working with you again."

* Feedback/Review from Sonia Gupta: "There is a minor typo in the first paragraph, it should say "components as reusable objects." I like the bag analogy you use, it's very approachable. Drawing similarities with HTML also makes the reader more comfortable, and your enthusiastic narration is fun to read!"


## F: The Plan

## G: Community

### Gear Up
#### Microagressions (Group 3)
* [Original Gear Up Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group3.md)

#### Journey Mapping
* [Original Gear Up Outline]()

My group loved this session. We decided to take a less technical approach to the journey mapping and instead mapped the user experience of a person playing Monopoly. At first it seemed like we were a little too far off topic, but honestly after the first few minutes of questions, it turned into a very serious discussion about users make decisions based on the information at hand. Our map included the 3 main areas and the discussions were around how these areas affected application design: chance (rolling dice), strategy, and completion. The drawing at the end was not as helpful to me as the actual discussion but I do think that a few members of the team really enjoyed the visual aspect of the discussion.

#### Grit Mindset
* [Original Gear Up Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

I had heard of this before, but never really dug into it. It was a great session to have at the end of the Module especially as a Module 4 student heading into my first Software Development role in just a few weeks. It really made me reflect on WHY I decided to come to Turing and give up my previous career. It also made me think long and hard about how Grit is not always a good thing - how sometimes it can lead to unhealthy behaviors. I have seen in myself and others the Grit taking over and things outside of our focus falling too far to the wayside. When all focus is directed on this one goal, does anything else suffer? Does anyONE else suffer? Do we has the Gritty person suffer? One idea we discussed in our group along with the idea I just mentioned was failing fast if one is to fail. What we meant by this, is that it would be better to fail quickly versus spending months, years on a passion that just isn't right for us. There is a lot of self-awareness that needs to come alongside Grit and I think finding and striking that balance is not only extremely important, but absolutely crucial.


## H: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

### Being a Community Member and Playing a Part

Try Turing - I have participated in two Try Turing Panels and have really enjoyed sharing my story with potential students. I enjoy talking about my school and my community. It is an amazing feeling to have someone walk up to me the first week of the module and tell me that I was part of their decision to apply to Turing. It gives me goosebumps to think that I might have had a part in helping someone else make this huge decision to change their life.

Pre-work guide (x3) - I have had the pleasure of being a Pre-work guide for 3 students (1610, 1611, and 1701). It has been humbling to answer questions, be vulnerable when I don't know answers, be honest about my experience, and watch these women coming into Turing and embrace the challenge. My 1610 and 1611 students are shining stars and I know after my Google Hangout conversation with my 1701 student that she is just as amazing.

SAB member (2 modules) - I have been on SAB for two modules and have really enjoyed my time representing 1606 Backend for those 12 weeks. I consider myself very lucky to be on the board and to be able to interact with representatives from the other 7 cohorts. Being so close to inner workings of Turing, attending Staff Retros, helping to shape the community has really been eye opening for me. Turing is a complicated place and it takes many, many people all working hand in hand to keep it running; SAB has given me the opportunity to see how this all comes together. Co-leading our cohort retros has been both great and intimidating all at the same time. Standing in front of my peers each week, reading their anonymous words in surveys and attempting to represent them to the best of my ability has been wonderful.

Imposters Lunch -
Imposters has gone through many changes since I started attending in Module 1. When I stepped up as a co-lead I helped shape it to be more of a coping session than a venting session. We actively spoke about how we can deal with feeling like an imposter, build up some tools for our "toolbox" to help with this, and support each other in our individual journeys.
