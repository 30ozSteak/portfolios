## C: Group Work & Projects

### Capstone Project

This project lasted all six weeks of the module, our cohort was split up into three teams with different projects. I was on team Enroll, which was an active enrollment app for Turing stufents. We were asked to implement new features as well as modify functionality so that it could communicate with another groups' project Census, the new authorization service for meant for most if not all Turing apps.

My main contributions were in the DevOps realm: setting up the app as well as the old auth service in a staging environment, congiuring auto-deployment, continuous integration testing(CI), and working with a third app, the Dashboard, which was a React app written by a Front End Engineering student and configuring auto-deploy and CI in that app as well. I also helped fix the test suite which had numerous failures when we inherited the code, as well as worked on the smart search feature for the admin dashboard of the Enroll app.

### Gear Up

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

I liked discussing this Gear up with our Cohort and Instructors. It was cool to see which personality type my fellow classmates identified with, and how they felt based on that criteria. I learned alot about myself as well, very valuable session.

* [GitHub Gist Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)


#### Vote Your Conscience

I thought this was a thought provoking session, maybe not as valuable as the other Gear Ups, but it fostered a great discussion. Being an election year, it was relevant and interesting to see how others viewed voting.

#### Resilience

This was a good Gear up as well. The discussion our group had was meaningful and productive. I learned alot about the people in my group and the struggles they have ahd to overcome.

## F: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for David Davydov

*  I have worked with David before and know that he is an incredibly strong programmer with a very clear grasp of theory and technical knowledge. Unfortunately I did not get to work much directly with David on this project as our assigned tasks never overlapped. I always learned so much from David whenever we had paired in the past and having him as a Technical Lead for our team was very valuable. He took his role seriously and offered to help to Rapha and I with a refactor when working on the smart search feature. His implementation was brilliant and very clean, which is further proof to me of the truly great things David will achieve as a software developer.

#### Feedback for Jean Joeris

* I have worked with Jean before and know that he is a fantastic programmer with very strong technical skills. He also has great soft skills and is a pleasure to work with. Jean served as our Project Manager for the Enroll team and took on many different tasks in addition to writing code. He organized tasks on Tracker, communicated with our CTO and Product Owner for the team, and made sure the group was making progress. Even though I did not really work with him on the project code, Jean did a great job as PM; he reminded me (respectfully) about tasks I had forgotten about, and truly took his responsibility seriously. My only advice to Jean would be to not be too hard on himself regarding his PM duties. He mentioned to me that he felt he was not performing as well as he would like, but I thought he did a great job. I have alot of respect for Jean and can’t wait to see what he can do once we graduate.

#### Feedback for Raphael Barbo

* I have worked with Rapha before and it is always great to work with him. He and I work well together and contribute code harmoniously when we pair. Unfortunately I only got to work with Rapha for one afternoon on this project, but it was on a cool feature: the smart search, and was very rewarding. Rapha is a strong coder and has a relentless motor; he is always hungry for more code and new things to try. I look forward to seeing what he can accomplish after we leave Turing.

#### Feedback for Sonia Gupta

* This was my first time working with Sonia and it was a great experience. We ended up serving as the ‘DevOps’ team for our project and paired on most tasks. This was a new field of study for us and thus we were learning as we went. Working with a brownfield project as well as a totally new technology is quite challenging but Sonia and I were persistent and came away with alot of new knowledge. Sonia is a pleasure to pair with, she is very conscientious and seeks collaboration both when driving and navigating. She also kept a strong set of notes with useful commands and processes so that when we needed to revisit things, we did not have to waste time searching for solutions that we had already discovered. Sonia is also a strong programmer technically, and I feel we worked well as a team and complimented each other in terms of technical knowledge and skill; it always felt as though we were on “the same page”. My only advice to Sonia would be to put more trust in her intuition. There were times where she would second guess herself, but more often than not, her instincts were right. Sonia was awesome to work with and even though we worked on the most mystifying and at times frustrating portion of the project, we emerged successful and I am excited to see what Sonia can accomplish once we leave Turing.

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback for Brian (From Jean Joeris)

* Brian was a great team member. He worked with Sonia very hard on DevOps and handling our deployment, which was harder than anyone expected. Issues kept coming up, yet he was willing to continue troubleshooting as long as needed. I regret I didn't get to work with him more often on this project, as I know from Mind on The Ball we work excellent together. He was very hard working throughout and I'm glad he was on Enroll 

#### Feedback for Brian (From Sonia Gupta)

* Brian has been the person I worked with most on this project, and every moment was truly a pleasure. Even when we were frustrated, I always felt we were in it together. I had never worked with Brian before this project, and I am truly lucky to now have had the opportunity to do so. Brian has patience, resilience, and an incredibly upbeat personality. He allowed me to explore potential solutions even if they didn't work, and he never talked down to me. He treated me as an equal, and was incredibly respectful and compassionate. I learned from him how to have a sense of humor about our frustrations, and he kept me optimistic even when I felt downtrodden. I'm really grateful to Brian for his kindness and camaraderie. It means more than I can say. :)

#### Feedback for Brian (From Raphael Barbo)

* It is always a pleasure working with Brian, he brings such a positive attitude and great energy and I absolutely love it. He is always cheerful and has such a great attitude towards everything and everyone. During our pairing session throughout this project, Brian was able to break down problems into small manageable partitions, explain the process, and make sure we both understood what was going on in the code base. Brian and I both work well together and contribute code harmoniously when we pair, and that for me is just an amazing treat. I absolutely love working with Brian... Can't wait to see where his coding skills take him.


### Playing a Part

* Armstrong Posse - I contributed during the creation of our linear regression app, and some lesson plans and participate regularly in posse meetings and discussions. Along with Jean Joeris created an app and built a neural net from scratch which will be used as a learning resource/example for the posse.
* Regularly empty dishes and load/run dishwashers in big workspace
* Organized disc-golf outings with the #disc-golfers channel
* Served as a Pre-Work Guide for incomming students
