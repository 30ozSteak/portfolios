# Nate Anderson - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to solidify my Rails knowledge as well as begin to dive in to the world of Javascript. I also
wanted to build my social media presence in anticipation of the upcoming job hunt. I also wanted to continue to work
with earlier modules as I really have enjoyed giving back after so much help was given to me at Turing in the 
beginning.

**Feedback to Me:**

From Dan Broadbent: Nate, I’m really glad we finally got to work together on a big project.  You were awesome to pair with.  When we were working together on figuring out how to filter our data with scopes, we got it to a great flow and it was the most fun I had all project.  I felt that I got to know you a lot better as a person and a programmer during this project.  Your positive attitude and willingness to take on any problem were a real asset to the team.  I’d be happy to work with you again.

From Susi Irwin: Nate, your analytical nature makes you such a pleasure to work with on projects and specifically on Monocle. You are not afraid to ask the tough questions of the Tech Lead, the Team, or the application itself. It is an absolute blast to work through problems with you. You have a knack of looking at the code and the problems from a different angle that I don't see. Your keen sense and intuition are incredible. Your work on Monocle has been outstanding.

### Gear Up

#### Resilience
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This was a subject that everyone at Turing can relate to. I really enjoy when we have these types of talks that directly
relate to our time at Turing. Stress is an everyday component and learning to deal with that as well as assorted roadblocks
is an essential life skill to have.

#### Introvert and Extrovert
* [GitHub URL](not available)

This was interesting as I was in a discussion group with the most extroverted people in the class with myself being more
on the introverted side. I think both sides got a lot out of it and it was productive talk.

#### Vote Your Conscience
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This was touchy discussion as people's personal politics got involved and rather heated at times. But the discussion period
was only 15 minute so it was short lived, but pretty awkward.

## Professional Development Workshops

#### Top 3 Priorities
* [Top 3 Priorities](https://gist.github.com/NateAnderson1780/f26d09f03b4f2c152722abbac16c1ef5)
* Completed Deliverables: Due Mon. 11/28/16

This was an exercise to narrow down your thoughts and interests on the job search in hopes of being able to more
specifically identify the areas most important when looking for a job out of Turing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Susi Irwin: Susi, it was so much fun to work with you again on a project. You keep everyone involved and engaged
and are just a fantastic team member in general. Your inquisitive nature helps me to clarify things I might not 
have even realized I was somewhat confused about myself. Watching how much you have grown as a developer in the
last 7 months has been amazing to watch. Your contributions to this project were immense and I can't wait to see
what you do in the future at Granicus and beyond. 

To Dan Broadbent: 

### Being a Community Member

I was able to work with a number of module 1 and 2 students during the past six weeks and I always enjoy it. I very much
remember the struggles of early modules and I received a lot of help myself so it is always very gratifying to work with
earlier module students. I estimate that I worked with 1-2 students a week at varying times.

### Playing a Part

Regularly provided assistance to peers, continued in prework guides slack channel to provide assistance to incoming Turing students.
