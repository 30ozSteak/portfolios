# Ben Pepper - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I'll be honest, I had no idea what to expect this mod. I wanted to work with Javascript and some React. I got to touch both so there's that. Outside of that I was hoping to solidify my Rails knowledge and got to do that with some more advanced database things like delegations.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Work

## Team

#### Quantified Self

* [Quantified Self](https://github.com/bfpepper/quantify-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

This was our first project done in Javascript. It involved working with local storage, JQuery, and multiple pages. This was a daunting project at first but Thankfully Ali knew what she was doing and was able to help me understand the project better by the end.

* 17 tests, all feature tests, all passing.
* Would like to have seen some sad path testing
* Opportunity to refactor with code duplication in Diary.
* Fully functional, no bugs.

### Functional Expectations
3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

### Testing
3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

### HTML/CSS/UI
3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.
### JS syntax and Style
3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

### Git Workflow
3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

### Project Management
4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

#### MentorShIP

* [MentorSHIP](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/MentorSHIP)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects_overview)

MentorSHIP is intended (when fully developed) to help students connect with mentors who are available. This is done as a full Rails app with the react-rails gem working on the front end.

### Project Management
4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.

### Completion & Pace
3: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner.

### Implementation Quality
3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

### Application of Techniques
3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.

### Documentation
3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

#### First Unitarian Society of Denver app

* [FUSD App](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/fusdIJC)

This is an app thought up by Kris Foss of 1603.  We attend the same church and the messaging system for the Immigration Justice group is appalling and confusing. They are currently using Google forums. This leads to email chains that are long, confusing and lack any real ability to comprehend the needs of the community. She and I have been working on making a site which can be easier to user and navigate. Our hope is to make this the hub for all communications so the community can better understand its own needs.

### Giving Feedback

To: Ali Schlereth
Ali is an amazing partner. Her grasp of JQuery and Javascript is stunning. She made Quantified Self far more tolerable and her enthusiasm when something finally worked was refreshing. Ali is more than capable as a programer and as a member of any team that she has been or will be a part of.

Ali, don't burn yourself out. Turing and the job can be draining and there will be times that things don't get done in time. Just roll with the punches and don't let it stress you. I know it's a tautological statement but the cards will fall where they will. There are a few things you can do to affect them but with any project there are too many moving parts to control. Just do you and you'll be fine.

To: Megan Talbot
It was a pleasure working with Megan again. Her dedication to the project and making things work is inspiring. Her ability to get thrown into a new situation and then fully grasp the concept was stunning and something I hope to emulate soon.

Megan, You always produce amazing apps with stunning code. You should always be proud of what you produce no matter what it is. I know we didn't get as far as you would have liked in MentorSHIP but the code we produced was good and sets up 1610 for a strong start. The work you put into the front end made the site easily navigable and easy to look at.

To: Jon Kimble
It was my first time work with Jon. I couldn't have asked for a better team member. He constantly beings enthusiasm and enjoyment into whatever he is doing. Jon constantly amazes me with his outgoing nature and that he always has a smile on his face. His drive to learn more each day is something I hope to emulate as I get into the industry.

Jon, You guys did a hell of a job getting React to work with MentorSHIP. I know we didn't get as far as you would have liked with the app but the codebase we are leaving for 1610 is far better than we were handed. Thats part of brown field, can we leave this better then we found it? We did. Thats a lot and will only serve to set up 1610 for quick success. You did a lot to help that and they will have you to thank for it.

To: Vido Seaver
This was the first project I worked on with Vido. His ability to understand a problem and tackle it is wonderful. He has an ability to look at a problem and see a solution. Several times we paired trying to figure out what the next step was and Vido was able to articulate the solution and navigate through all the issues.

Vido, I know it can be frustrating taking steps back in a project. Its shitty to re-do something several times and have to wait for other things to complete. Its part of the job. Getting stressed hurts you and your team. Try to take a step back and just roll with the punches when they come. You know what you're doing and can accomplish a lot. Just control what you can and let the other things fall by the way side.
