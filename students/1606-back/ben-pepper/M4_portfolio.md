## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I'll be honest, I had no idea what to expect this mod. I wanted to work with Javascript and some React. I got to touch both so there's that. Outside of that I was hoping to solidify my Rails knowledge and got to do that with some more advanced database things like delegations.

### Work

## Team

#### Quantified Self

* [Quantified Self](https://github.com/bfpepper/quantify-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

This was our first project done in Javascript. It involved working with local storage, JQuery, and multiple pages. This was a daunting project at first but Thankfully Ali knew what she was doing and was able to help me understand the project better by the end.

* 17 tests, all feature tests, all passing.
* Would like to have seen some sad path testing
* Opportunity to refactor with code duplication in Diary.
* Fully functional, no bugs.

### Functional Expectations
3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

###Testing
3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

### HTML/CSS/UI
3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.
### JS syntax and Style
3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

### Git Workflow
3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

### Project Management
4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

#### MentorShIP

* [MentorSHIP](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/MentorSHIP)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects_overview)

MentorSHIP is intended (when fully developed) to help students connect with mentors who are available. This is done as a full Rails app with the react-rails gem working on the front end.

#### First Unitarian Society of Denver app

* [FUSD App](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/fusdIJC)

This is an app thought up by Kris Foss of 1603.  We attend the same church and the messaging system for the Immigration Justice group is appalling and confusing. They are currently using Google forums. This leads to email chains that are long, confusing and lack any real ability to comprehend the needs of the community. She and I have been working on making a site which can be easier to user and navigate. Our hope is to make this the hub for all communications so the community can better understand its own needs.
