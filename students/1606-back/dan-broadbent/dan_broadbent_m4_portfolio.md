# Dan Broadbent - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I didn't know what all I should expect since we were trying out a new curriculum.  I was very exctied about the idea of doing a longer project with a bigger group.  This would give us practice working in a situation that would be more similar to on the job, where we don't just move on from a project after one or two weeks.  I was also excited about the potential to explore an area of interest whether it be dev ops, a new language, or a front end framework.  My focus is the front end framework, since I already got my first experience with Angular 2 in my mod 3 personal project.

REDID THE HOT AND TOP FUNCTIONALITY TO UPDATE PROGRESS TO A 3. 

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 4: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with no bugs and has one or more supporting feature implemented.
* __3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.__
* 2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* __4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* __3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* __3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.__
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they're written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

### 5. User Interface

* __4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use__
* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

### 6. Workflow

* __4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.__
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that do
