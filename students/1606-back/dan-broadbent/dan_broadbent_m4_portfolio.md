# Dan Broadbent - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I didn't know what all I should expect since we were trying out a new curriculum.  I was very exctied about the idea of doing a longer project with a bigger group.  This would give us practice working in a situation that would be more similar to on the job, where we don't just move on from a project after one or two weeks.  I was also excited about the potential to explore an area of interest whether it be dev ops, a new language, or a front end framework.  My focus is the front end framework, since I already got my first experience with Angular 2 in my mod 3 personal project.
