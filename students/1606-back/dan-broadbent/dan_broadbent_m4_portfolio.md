# Dan Broadbent - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I didn't know what all I should expect since we were trying out a new curriculum.  I was very exctied about the idea of doing a longer project with a bigger group.  This would give us practice working in a situation that would be more similar to on the job, where we don't just move on from a project after one or two weeks.  I was also excited about the potential to explore an area of interest whether it be dev ops, a new language, or a front end framework.  My focus is the front end framework, since I already got my first experience with Angular 2 in my mod 3 personal project.

REDID THE HOT AND TOP FUNCTIONALITY TO UPDATE PROGRESS TO A 3. 

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* __3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.__
* 2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* __4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* __3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* __3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.__
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they're written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

### 5. User Interface

* __4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use__
* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

### 6. Workflow

* __4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.__
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that do

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

For the final mod, we were given one project that lasted the entire six weeks.  We were divided up into groups of four or larger and used agile develpment strategies throughout the six weeks.  We used Pivotal Tracker to manage the project, keep track of our current sprint, progress, and ideas for future features.

#### Monocle

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danbroadbent/monocle)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects_overview)

Monocle is meant to be a job hunt research tool.  When our team took over the project, it was just a barebones Rails app that allow users to sign in through Slack, view a list of companies, and search by city.

Since Monocle is a tool where all the team members are also the intended users, we got to put a lot of our own input as to how it should look and behave.  The first set of features we developed revolved around allowing user generated content.  Students are always discovering new companies that might be hiring grads and we wanted to give them the ability to add those to the database.  To ensure that the companies that we being added are good quality and accurate, after they are submitted, they are sent to a queue for review by either a moderator or an admin.

The next big phase of the project was displaying company information in a compelling way.  We decided that the best format would be something similar to Airbnb, with company information cards that look like LinkedIn.  We implemented a two column layout with filters to narrow your company search down on the left, and a map view with pins of companies on the right with the companies listed underneath the map.

The final phase of the project was taking our new javascript skills and applying them to what we had already done.  For the homepage, the company filters were changed to javascript using jQuery and ajax to filter down companies without reloading the page.  On the companies detail page we used the same technology to make starring companies and adding notes to companies work fully without reloading the page.

The most difficult part of the project for me was working on making the company notes have full CRUD functionality with javascript.  It was the most difficult because javascript was new to us this module and we just didn't have the same familiarity that we do with Rails.  It was a really fun project and I can't wait to see what future teams will add to it.

## D: Professional Development

This module we had some real world requirements as we make our way closer to entering our first jobs.  Our main requirement was to reach out to several developers in the community for informal meetings to get a better sense of what's out there and maybe get some potential leads for jobs.  I also began applying to jobs this module, which proved to be quite successful.  I have had many calls with companies, several technical challenges, and one on location interview.

### Playing a Part

This module I was co-lead of the Bezos posse with Madison Kerndt from the front end program.  This is the second module we have lead, and continued to work for the changes we wanted to see in the posse.  Our main goal was to make the posse more practical and hands on, giving students experience and discussions that would be valueable after leaving Turing.

The topics that we covered this module included communcation and pitching, user testing, and business plans.  We also had really great speakers this module, obviously Jeff, and also Pana CEO Devon Tivona.  We also had another speaker move to next module because of poor weather. I lead the Friday Spikes on Pitching and User Testing.  I'm really proud of the direction we took the posse, and the students who attended reguarly got a lot out of it.
