# Brendan Dillon - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I hoped to encounter and learn strategies to deal with the problems that occur in a legitimately large project.  In addition, I was hoping to learn more about databases and database management via personal learning and also by pairing with students in Mod 2 and Mod 3 who are working on SQL and ActiveRecord.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

```
Notes:

* missing link title validation


### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* 4: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with no bugs and has one or more supporting feature implemented.
* __3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.__
* 2: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.
* 1: Developer fails to complete sections 1 through 5 or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API

* __4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* __3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer can manipulate Javascript syntax but implementation is buggy or inconsistent.
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of Javascript syntax and idioms

### 4. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for *both* design and verification. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.
* __3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.__
* 2: Developer uses tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover. Application is missing tests in a needed area such as model, integration, or controller tests.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but they're written after or in the middle of implementation.
* 0: Developer does not use tests to guide development.

### 5. User Interface

* 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* __3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality__
* 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective
* 1: The application is confusing or difficult to use

### 6. Workflow

* __4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.__
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 2: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 1: The developer commited the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0: The application was not checked into version control.
```


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The only project I worked on individually this module was the Open Source project. While this was a personal project in the sense that I was not collaborating with other students, I found myself using the skills that I have learned in group projects to communicate clearly and make neat commits.

#### Contributing to Open Source

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder/pull/1140)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/the-plan/assignments/open-source)
* [Blog Post]()

I worked on the Geocoder gem. It had a bug with the Rake task that it used to geocode all records in a database that prevented it from working correctly with projects that used Mongoid instead of ActiveRecord. Most of the time for this project was spent researching what the code was supposed to do with respect to batching. Setting up projects to test the gem with both ActiveRecord and Mongoid was also tricky and interesting, since I had never previously used MongoDB or Mongoid.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group project for this module was definitely an exercise in figuring out how to use project management tools effectively. Previously, projects were only two weeks long at most, so the entire project fit into a sprint and could be tackled well. Working on a six-week project definitely drove home the importance of actually doing sprint planning and deciding on the features that we could accomplish. We weren't always effective at planning out what was feasible to do in a two-week sprint or accomplishing what we set out to.

#### Monocle

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danbroadbent/monocle)

Monocle is a job-tracking app. We started with a brownfield project, as Calaway built out a CRUD app for jobs. We added admin functionality, AJAX filtering, an interactive Google map, AJAX starring, AJAX notes, a way to display data from the LookingFor service and persist jobs that a user had starred into our database, and the ability to log in with the Census application.

## D: Professional Development
As the job search looms with a terrifying and imposing presence over our heads, the professional development became both crucial and anxiety-inducing.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Overcoming Imposter's Syndrome
This workshop was a good reminder that we are all in the same boat, and not to freak out too much.

#### Negotiations
This workshop provided good strategies for approaching a negotiation in a polite but assertive way. If I hadn't had this session, I would have been totally in the dark about the protocol for salary negotiations and would have probably have wound up undercutting myself out of fear that I was going to cross a line.

#### Writing a Blog Post and Peer Review
This workshop gave me some insight as to how to make a blog post useful for its audience, especially with keeping the audience in mind and specifically defining any technical jargon that you use.
