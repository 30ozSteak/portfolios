##Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
##CSS/Design
4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
##React Router
3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.
Testing
3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing
##Wireframes
Pass - Developer team laid out their thinking using wireframes before building their project
##PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
##README Updates
Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running
##Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint showsâ€¦
4 - Zero complaints

##Workflow
4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) are using a rebase workflow, effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

#### MOVIETRACKER

Movie Tracker This project allows users to sign in and save their favorite movies under their profile. It was made using The Movie DB API and Create-React-App.

##Specification Adherence
3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

##Project Professionalism
4 - All requirements from 3 met, codebase has zero linter errors/warnings and readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a complete mastery of React architecture.
##Testing
3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async functionality.
##Redux Architecture
3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.
##Routing
3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
