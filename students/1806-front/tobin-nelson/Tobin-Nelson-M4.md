### Cut-off date for having a full-time position
 
April 1, 2019

### Daily Practice Repo

My daily practice Repo has many activities already in it that I have worked on since mid-December. Some of the challenges are from class and mid-mock assessments, others are propmpts I have found online. I also have listed many additional short projects that I can work on. In addition I have an Exercisms repo. My plan is to continually focus on these areas:
  * React
  * Vanilla JaveScript
  * jQuery
  * CSS
  * Code Challenges (Exercisms, CodeWars, etc.)

### List monthly, weekly, and daily goals

* Monthly Goals: I want to apply to 8-12 jobs a month and have 2-3 interviews. If I am not getting actual job interviews, then it will be important to schedule mock interviews to continue my practice and keep my interview skills sharp. Each month I will reflect on my job search and look at what went well and what did not go well. Then I can adjust plans to make sure that I am giving myself the best chance to find employment.

* Weekly Goals: Apply to 2-3 jobs each week, including all the necessary cold outreach. I need to practice code challenges everyday. My time each day to practice code challenges is definitely a priority so that I can feel confident going into an interview. Each week I will assess the week that passed. I will look at my schedule, what went well and what did not go well. Then I will make adjustments to my planning. I want to make sure that I am as efficient as possible with my time and energy.

* Daily Goals: Each day I have a planned out itinerary. Everyday I will prioritize my agenda to make sure I am getting what needs to get done. My goal is to stick to the plan and hold myself accountable. By checking in with cohortmates regularly I will be able to keep myself accountable to all of my goals.

### List 3 people you will reach out to. 

I don't know three people I haven't yet reached out to but I'll be talking to everyone.

### List 3 meetups you'll attend
 
 * React Denver - Keep up on React skills and learn about React-related opportunities here in Denver Next Jan 15
 * Code for Denver - To learn about Civic Tech in Denver and be able to collaborate with other developers outside of the Turing community. Every Monday
 * Denver Javascript Meetup - To stay involved with Javascript related topics in Denver Next Jan 17
 * Rocky Mountain Angular - I'd like to attend to have an introduction to angular. Next Jan 17
 
### Job Search Tracking System
 
I have a spreadsheet that I use to track jobs I am interested in and/or have applied to, and all relevant information for the jobs. I update it daily. I started a Trello but found it to not be as efficient as i'd like. 

### List 2-3 areas to improve on for interviewing 

* Programming concepts articulation - I have created a study guide of many of the topics and study regularly. I am adding topics to the list all the time as well. I also practice this with peers when we ask each other questions and rehearse answers.

* Story-telling about projects and relating those stories to major takeaways that illustrate my character. I have written many of these stories out to branistorm them and put it down on paper. I review them often and have practiced this story telling in interviews.

* Whiteboarding- I am learning more about the process and practicing whiteboarding techniques. I have some resources that have been helpful in improving these skills and will continue to practice the skill. I know I wont have all the answers, but I'd like to at least approach it with calmer nerves.

### Summary of your LinkedIn profile
 
I have made many updates to my LinkedIn account over the past weeks. My profile represents all the work I have done at Turing and is up to date.

### List additional area you'll focus on in your job search
 
I have only searched here in Denver. If I do not feel much traction here then I will expand my search to other areas.

### List 1-2 people you'll check in with during job search

I plan to checkin with some of my fellow classmates on a regular basis and meetup for code challenge practice and to review interview/articulation practice. I will checkin regularly with Alex E, Alex B, Ben, Chris

I also have developed a good relationship with a mentor that I'll check-in with him from time-to-time.
 
### List 1-2 "barriers" and describe how you will overcome them

Family demands- I need to be more involved with some challenges going on in my family in the coming weeks and months. I overcome this by planning time specifically to be with family and help. And I accept that family comes first and don't guilt myself when I have to close the computer to be present. 

 
## 2: Supporting Cohortmates in Job Search

### List 1-2 people from PD Peer Group who you will continue to check in with during the first 30 days post-graduation. Describe your plans for these check-ins
 
I will check in with Chris regularly. We have worked well together. I will describe to him the jobs I am applying for and get his feedback. If needed I can run some cover letters by him or talk to him about his approaches to cold outreach. As we get further along in the process, I think we can discuss our interview experiences and learn from each others experiences.
 
 ### Describe one area of the job search that you feel particularly skilled in to help your cohortmates
 
I think I am skilled at interview practice and giving feedback to interview style question/answers. I have been an interviewer and can give really good feedback in this area. I am happy to do mock interviews with anyone to practice.
