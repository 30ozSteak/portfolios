#### NumberGuesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/NumberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#### Overview

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).

* Awesome copying the comp.  Super clean.
* Taking it to the next step, adding aria roles/labels.
* Use cascading stylesheets effectively so you don't need multiple spans in your h1.
* Organize CSS based on element, class, id, etc.
* Grouping classes together that have similar rules/properties.
* Make sure functions in event listeners are consistent
* Cleaning up redundant code and moving them into their own functions
* Make sure to clean up logs
