# Tobin Nelson - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Mod 3 was a focused period of time for myself where I wanted to start to push my work beyond simply meeting requirements. I felt a continually upward progress coming out of Mod 2 and felt it was time to push myself further. My goal was to not simply keep from drowning, but start to swim and build on progress. I think I was able to succeed in that goal. The mod was very intense, time consuming, and challenging, and I gave it everything I could. I felt a huge gain in my testing ability from feeling totally lost in it coming out of Mod 2, to being able to tackle any test on any of the projects and with enough persistence, have success. I have really enjoyed React, and took this Mod to continue to learn and develop these skills. Redux added a complex new wrinkle, my base understanding is solid and look forward to continuing to build understanding in Redux.

-----------------------

## A: Final Project

#### Nickel Trivia

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/nickel-trivia)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)

Description: Nickel Trivia is a Trivia Game built for grandparents to play with their grandchildren. This user friendly App takes advantage of the OpenTrivia Database to populate the game with fun, and accessible trivia questions for users. Participants are awarded virtual nickels as points to keep score. The Landing Page directs users to two paths, a Question of the Day and a Group Trivia Game. In its current iteration, the game would best be faciliated by a leader in a group. In future iterations, the App will have multi-player options allowing friends and families to compete amongst each other.

Evaluation scores: 
Specification Adherence
* 3 - The application uses the above technologies to a professional level. The evaluator has minimal recommendations for refactoring or design changes.

Project Professionalism
* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

Testing
* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).

Redux Architecture
* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

Routing
* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for undefined routes.


## B: Projects

#### Jedi Archives Access

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/Jedi-Archives-Access)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Description: Jedi Archives Access allows a user to role-play as a Jedi Master at some point within the established Star Wars film universe. Upon arrival, a user logs into a secure data interface that initializes a narrative connection sequence. Upon login, the user is presented with a situation report (one of the opening film crawl texts, chosen at random), followed by a series of access points relaying information about people, places, and transports that are pertinent to their mission. Users can hover over cards to gather information and click on them to add to their saved repository.

Evaluation scores: 

Specification Adherence 
- 3 - The application completes all 6 iterations.

Code Quality
- 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

CSS/Design
- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

React Router
- 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

Testing
- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

Wireframes
- Pass - Developer team laid out their thinking using wireframes before building their project

PropType Implementation
- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

README Updates
- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running

Code Sanitation
- 4 - Zero complaints

Workflow
- 3.5 -


#### coenCollection

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Tobin-jn/coenCollection)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Description: coenCollection is an app that serves as a catalogue for the films of the Coen Brothers. Users can navigate the app to see all the films of the famed directors. Hover over the poster image to find an overview of the film along with the release date. Upon login, users can favorite the films and also view just their favorited films. New users are asked to sign up before logging in.

Evaluation Scores: 
Specification Adherence
* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or 
  more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.
  
Project Professionalism
* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, codebase has zero linter errors/warnings and
  readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase
  workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a
  complete mastery of React architecture.

Testing
* 2 - Nearly all unit tests for Redux and React are in place. No attempt to test
  async functionality was made.

Redux Architecture
* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the
  store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

Routing
* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.



## C: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I always try my best to support the community here at Turing. This mod I had the opportunity to pair with some students in Mod 2. I participated in the code fair and volunteered fior a few Turing related events. Turing Denver Startup Week I volunteered at the Turing table. I also was a TA at a Try Turing weekend event. I have enjoyed being a student at Turing this mod and am very happy with how the past 6 weeks went.
