30-Day Job Search Action Plan

Action Step #1: Establish a shareable calendar (like Google Calendar) and block out time on your calendar now to adhere to these goals. Be prepared to show this calendar to your instructors during your portfolio review.

Job/Company Research & Tracking
Success in the job search means staying organized. The best way to do that is to have a clear system to keep track of your contacts, research, and updates on what you're doing.

Action Step: 
- I have a job search Trello board

Interview Prep

Action Step: 
- For technical interviews, I will do daily challenges to improve my skills
- For cultural interviews, I will practice answering interview questions I have saved from Jeff

Housekeeping

Action Step #1: 
- I will update my projects, but other than that, it's already up to date

Action Step #2: 
- LinkedIn is up-to-date, but I will continue to add/modify parts of my profile as I grow as a developer

Other

Action Step: 
- I would like to continue working on World of Flags. It's in a good spot, but I'd like to make it better, with more features

Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?

Action Step: 
- My mentor, Thomas
- My job hunt team

Identifying & Overcoming Barriers

Action Step: Identify 1-2 "barriers" you might put on yourself in this job search as well as the steps you will take to overcome them. Be prepared to describe these in your M4 portfolio review.
- I am going out of town for a weekend at the end of January. I'll still have all of my things with me that I use for coding and job searching, so I will have a lot of time to continue working on those. Although I'm going out of town, I don't have any plans, so I'd like to work either in my hotel room or at a coffee shop for most of the time.
