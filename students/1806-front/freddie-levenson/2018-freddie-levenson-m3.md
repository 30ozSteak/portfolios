# Freddie Levenson - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Mod 3 was an awesome experience for me. Having most of the necessary foundational techniques from mods 1 & 2 under my belt mod 3 was an opportunity to explore some more complex concepts that allowed us to build websites and applications that acted in the same was as a website you might encounter in the real world. Utilizing a back end in a project like Movie Tracker, and using react in conjunction with router and redux allowed us to make applications that created a more complex and interesting user experience than what we could create in the past.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

Could improve some articulation or be more prepared to admit when I do not know the syntax of something

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Head Count 2.0

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/headcount2.0)
- [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Headcount was a great re-introduction to react and working with a complex and disorganized large dataset. It was nice to be tested off the bat on our skills from mod 2, as it was impossible to get started until you cleaned up the data. I learned a lot from this project, mostly that my original concept of how to use react had a lot of room for improvement. It was a great way to kick off the mod and prepared us for the projects ahead

#### BeerBrainBattle

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/beer_brainbattle)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)

BeerBrainBattle and the Binary Challenge were probably my favorite part of the mod. The project was our first opportunity to create an idea from (nearly) the ground up. We were given nothing more than a target audience and an api, and asked to come up with and build an idea to satisfy your target audience. I recieved "craft beer enthusiasts" as my target audience and the openTDB trivia api. The app I created was a trivia-drinking-game where you can challenge your friends or people at the bar to see who has to buy the next round. I feel I made a fun app that also demonstrates my comfort in the realms of react, redux, router, Async JS and testing all of the above.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### SW-api Box

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/hj-fl-SWAPI-Box)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPI-box was our first opportunity to use router with react to build an application that functions like a multi-page website would. We used the Star Wars API to populate our data, which was definitely a tough test of our asynchronous javascript skills. The API required a chain of fetch calls in order to get all the required data to display, which was a huge challenge but rewarding when it was completed.

#### Movie Tracker

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/flevenson/movie-tracker-frontend)
- [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie Tracker was our first exercise in communicating with a local back-end. We created a movie trackign website that you could log in to and save your favorites. Accounts and favorites were stored on the back end and a user could go back in and their favorites would persist. We used a rebase workflow and did most of the project TDD style, testing before writing the code. I learned so much from this project and my project partners from working this way.

## D: Community Participation

I participate in the community at Turing a ton. I started a posse that met twice a week (whiteboard posse) and had the front end and back end uniting to solve problems and practice our articulation. I also helped run Iron FE sessions and often paired with mod 2 students whenever they needed help. I also paired with my own classmates whenever help was needed. I attended the demo comp and nearly every wrap-up. I was also always attentive in class and was sure to participate whenever the opportunity arizes.

### Playing a Part

I play my part at turing by doing my best to unite our cohort and keep spirits light. I try to be a friend to everyone, beyond just someone who can occasionally help with code. I try to lift people up whenever they are down, which can often occur when the projects and material to learn are just never ending. I'm excited to participate in the SAB next mod!
