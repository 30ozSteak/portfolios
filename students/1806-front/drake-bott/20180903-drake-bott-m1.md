# Drake Bott - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Learn the fundamentals.  Coming into Turing I had no experience with HTML, CSS, or Javascript.  My past experience with some light coding in Highschool from 2? years back was in Java, and 5? years ago in Python.  I feel that I have the fundmentals down, but I am definitely a lot stronger with Javascript than CSS.  My CSS works, but could be better I think.  My most recent partner evaluation hit spot on I think.  My partner pointed out that I often just shoot to finish what is required, but with the extra time I could be pushing myself further to learn more.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual work for mod 1 is the Number Guesser project.  It was the first project assigned in the mod.

#### Number Guesser

#####  [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bottd/Number-Guesser)
#####  [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

#####  Intro
* Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.  This project was an intro to DOM manipulation, and my first time using javascript.

##### Evaluation comments: 
 * Keep in mind UX (user experience)
 * Add save button for min/max
 * Being able to use reset button without having to make a guess
 * Adding aria labels for inputs and buttons
 * Small refactor: use of multiple spans in title instead of using cascading styles
 * Cleaning up styles and removing repeated lines
 * Add some spacing for CSS and javascript for readability
 * Careful of nested if/else statements
 * Use function declarations for event listeners that have the same functionality to remove repeated code

##### Evaluation scores
 * Functional Expectations: Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
 * COMP RECREATION / DESIGN: Advanced Beginner
 * HTML: Advanced Beginner / Proficient
 * CSS: Advanced Beginner
 * JS/jQuery: Advanced Beginner
 * Surprise and Delight: Hot Fire


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

After Number Guesser, the rest of our Javascript related projects were done in randomly assigned groups of 2.  These projects were Linked List, Idea Box, & 2DoBox Pivot.

#### Linked List

#####  [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bottd/Linked-List)
#####  [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

* Linked List was a simple application where the user has 2 input fields, one for a title and another for a url.  The user enters text into both fields and can submit to add it to the page.  This was the first time I had been adding new HTML to the DOM with javascript.

##### Evaluation comments
 * HTML
  * Use aria labels
  * Utilize semantic html more - ie. header tags instead of section with class of header
 * CSS
  * Love those organizational comments
  * Be sure to google syntax of media queries while implementing
  * dry it up
 * JS
  * Work on indentation - follow the style guides!
  * dry it up
  * Use template literals!
 * Git/Github
  * Need More commits!!!

##### Evaluation scores
* Functional Expectations
 * Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
 * Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
* COMP RECREATION / DESIGN: Advanced Beginner / Proficient
* HTML: Proficient

##### Feedback to me
* I really appreciated your flexibility and patience during our first project. You took the time to let me talk through our code to make sure that I understood. I also appreciated your flexibility with our pairing sessions, whether it was remote or in person. Thank you! I encourage you to remain flexible and patient with your future partners that may be less confident in their coding abilities. These qualities made working together beneficial and enjoyable.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Since I wasn't really around much after class due to commuting, I tried to stay active in the couple 1806 chat channels being as helpful as possible and working towards answering as many questions as I could people had problems came up.
