# Aaron Weissman Mod 3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal this module was to become comfortable in react using redux. I wanted to feel confident that I could effectively build the front end of an application. I know there is still a lot to learn, but at this stage I feel great about the progress I've made.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aweissman11/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

There are no evaluation scores available for Headcount. 

Headcount was a good first project for this mod because it was a helpul reminder how to do some basic things with react. In addition, it was a good way to practice working with data.


#### Binary Challenge - Goin Campin

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aweissman11/goin-campin)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)
* [Instructor Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-3/binary-challenge/aaron/scores.md)

This project was, in my opinion, the most challenging one for me so far, but also has the potential to be the most rewarding. It was challenging because of both time constraints and because I did not have teammates to rely on for the things I'm not as strong with.

It was extra rewarding because I was able to do it all myself and I successfully tested the entire project with full coverage on everything that matters.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### SWAPI Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aweissman11/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)
* [Instructor Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-3/swapi/aaron/scores.md)

SWAPI Box was a great opportunity to get into and play around with an API. The api had plenty of data, but moved slow, which made for a good learning experience for things like loading screens and how to handle things when the data does not come back right away.

##### Feedback
Sara and I worked well together and got done what we were hoping to get done. At first I think our working styles clashed a bit, as I prefer to work from home and she likes to live pair. After a couple days though, we sat back down and talked through how each of us wanted to approach the rest of the project and found a great middle ground.


#### Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aweissman11/frontend-movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [Instructor Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-3/movie-tracker/aaron-laura-kevin/scores.md)

Movie Tracker was my favorite project so far at turing, mostly because of my team on this one.
Having three people, all of whom were ready go, allowed us to build a much more robust and complete application. The application is thoroughly tested, the UI works well, and the code is clean and refactored.
I think knowing that others were taking care of other things allowed me, personally, to really focus on writing good, reusable and readable code for this project and I think it turned out great.

##### Feedback
Laura and Kevin were truly a pleasure to work with and I hope I get a chance to work with them again.


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I'm mostly just trying to be available to folks in lower mods and to keep my head above water.
I attended the NASA Hackathon with a bunch of Turing students and teachers though, which was fun and a good learning experience. While there, I was also able to pair with and get to know some folks from other mods/programs.
