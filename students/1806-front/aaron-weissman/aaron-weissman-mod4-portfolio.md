**Action Step #1:** Establish a shareable calendar (like Google Calendar) and block out time on your calendar *now* to adhere to these goals. Be prepared to show this calendar to your instructors during your portfolio review.
[calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=OG5nam9nZmUwNHBybGFtOXVndGp1bjZiMjhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

**Action Step #2:** Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?
By my 30th birthday, April 7th, I need to have started a new job. 

Mental evaluations of the process every monday (maybe a blog post).
Check in with Kate if at any point those don't feel great. Otherwise, even if process is going great, if I don't have a job, I'll check in with kate at the end of the theirty days.

**Action Step #3:** Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals to reach in order to reach your big goal:
Minimum daily goals:
 - Write one cover letter
 - Submit one application
 - Send one cold or warm outreach email/slack/linkedin etc.
 - One commit
 
Weekly goals:
 - 10 commits
 - 5 apps
 - 1 coffee meeting
 
Monthly goals:
 - 3 offers
 - 1 rejection

* What skills would you like to improve or develop?
 - Backend of all kinds
 - Publish to AWS
 - Create my own website aaronweissman.com
 - SalesForce
 
* Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up?
 - I need to work on my design chops. I'm hoping to make a few iterations of my portfolio site
* Are there new languages or technologies you'd like to learn? How and when will you do that?
 - I am going to see if I get invited to a second round of any interviews. If so, I'll dive head first into their stack.

**Action Step:** Establish a “daily-practice” repository
 - This will be exercisms

**Action Step #1:** 
 - Tai: friend of mine who works at Slalom Build. He has already connected me with a recruiter there, but I am hoping to pick his brain anyway.
 - Johnny Woo: Husband of a good friend. Senior Dev at MapQuest. Just want to chat with him a bit and see if he knows anyone who might be looking for a dev. Used to work with his wife and we worked great together, so hopefully that will help.
 - Dave Tianiniaow: College buddy and former Turing grad. Gonna bug him about lots of stuff becuase I can.
 - chris: Husband of a friend of a friend. Am going to try to track him down though as he mentioned I should.

**Action Step #2:**
 - React Meetup is one I'll go to whenever possible.
 - I will not be here for the next Angular meetup, but may try to attend the next one
 - Networking is something I basically used to have to do for a living, so I'm not worried about sparking conversations with hiring steakholders at all, but this prompt reminded me that I should  do some speaking. I will try to give a talk at one of the React meetups.

### Job/Company Research & Tracking
Success in the job search means staying organized. The best way to do that is to have a clear system to keep track of your contacts, research, and updates on what you're doing.

**Action Step:** 
I have a spreadsheet to keep track of everything that I can share with Kayt, my job coach.

### Interview Prep
Interviews and that human interaction piece are definitely my strong suit. That being said, every once and a while I get a code challenge that completely stumps me and I realized that I need practice not only figuring them out, but how to explain my thinking when I don't know the answer in a way that still showcases my knowledge.

**Action Step:** 
I plan to do a ton of exercisms and code challenges.
Additionally, my knowledge of topics outside of the frontend is prett limited, so I am going to try to learn some simple backend skills to give myself some context for when those conversations do come up.

### Housekeeping
Make sure you have all your job search components up-to-date and looking their best!

**Action Step #1:** 
All set, but could use some love.

**Action Step #2:** 
My linkeding is exhaustive at the moment. Since Turing, I updated the photo, the skills, the job history, and the description.

### Other
* Blogging
* Speaking at a meetup

**Action Step:** 
I'm hoping to get a job building CRMs or something similar BAAS or SAAS or something. Therefore, I am going to work on learning a bit of Salesforce as that keeps coming up on job applications.

### Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?
I'd like to check in with Kayt every week or so.

**Action Step:** 
I'll check in with Kayt, my buddy who went to Turing, and my mentor.

### Identifying & Overcoming Barriers
Procrastination, procrastination, procrastination. I need to stay the course and do my daily dilligence.
Additionally, I need to keep the process moving even if it looks likely I may have found a job. Even if I'm progressing through an application process, I need to continue to apply daily so that I keep sharp and don't end up in a spot where I'm banking on something that never happens.

**Action Step:** 
I mentioned it above, but I am worried about procrastination and lack of motivataion when it comes to the daily grind of applications and cover letters.
I plan to just push myself to hold the course. My girlfriend will help hold me accountable, and I'll put some pressure on myself to report to Kayt with concrete updates.

## #3: Post-Grad Plans & Action Steps
In this section, you'll find action steps that you should aim to complete during your first 30 days post-grad, but these are not steps that you need to have completed for your portfolio review. Instead, you should begin thinking about how you will achieve these steps, and your post-grad job search support coach will ask about progress on these during that first 30 days.

**Scheduling Post-Grad Action Step:** At the end of each week during your first 30 days, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. This will also help you keep a record of what you've done in your job search.

**Outreach Post-Grad Action Step:** During the first 30 days, you should aim to reach out to at least 10 individuals. Even if you don't have a list of all 10 for the draft of this plan for portfolio review, be prepared to meet this target during your first 30 days of the job search.

**Job/Company Research & Tracking Post-Grad Action Step:** Reach out to and apply to at least 10 companies/jobs.

**Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #1:** During this timeframe, you should establish a “master” resume that you’ll customize per employer. You should already have a working version that you submitted in Module 3.

**Housekeeping Post-Grad Action Step #2:** Establish a “master” cover letter with your key talking points that you'll customize per employer.
