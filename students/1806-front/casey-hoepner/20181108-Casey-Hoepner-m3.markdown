# Casey Hoepner - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to solidify my knowledge of React and gain a strong understanding of Redux. In addition to that, I wanted to continue to wrap my head around testing. I also wanted to gain confidence in my coding abilities. I intentionally forced myself to struggle longer before asking for help this mod. I wanted to prove to myself that I could figure things out. Of course, I asked for help a lot this mod, but I made sure to try for a while first instead of determining immediately that I couldn't do something and that I needed help. It helped a lot, and imposter syndrome hasn't crept up as much for me.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod was tough. We all needed each other, and I think we all did a great job of being there for each other. I made sure to help anyone who came to me with questions, and my peers did the same for me. I also volunteered to be a TA for Try Coding during week 4 and Success at Turing during week 2. I made sure to check in on the 1810 students that I had met at Success at Turing to make sure they were acclimating well.
