# Jessica Erickson - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I had four overarching goals: 

* learn how to be an efficient and effective programmer
     
* learn how to be an efficient and effective group partner
     
* practice trusting and accepting the help of others
     
* practice managing my mental health in a high-stress environment that is similar to a workplace environment

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My participation in the overall Turing community has been more sparse than I would like, but I believe I have made a few valuable contributions. 

First, I have been very open about my mental health status while at Turing. In the first few weeks, I demonstrated what my self-care kit was and did a simple explanation of each part, in order to help others see how easy a self-care kit is to make and how valuable it can be in high stress environments. After that, several people have talked to me about how they appreciated me being open about my mental health status; Some people had struggles of their own, and weren't comfortable with being open about it, but did appreciate that I put mental health concerns on the radar, so to speak; Others knew people who struggled, and found my openness helpful and refreshing.

In addition to being a known quanity in regards to my mental health, I've also brought attention to how people like me might be affected by website design, use of new technologies (particularly AR and VR), and the structure of classes at Turing. This has led to several conversations with other students, ranging in scope from the morality of having PTSD-inducing VR experiences even available to how to make mental health treatment resources more accessible and easier to find. I have also given the instructors some feedback pertaining to the structure of some of the lessons that tripped me up, in the hopes that it might help anyone in the following cohorts who are trying to take on Turing with Social Anxiety/Depression/PTSD.

Second, I have been working on making a hydra test for the mythical-creatures javascript-foundations challenges. It will hopefully help future students understand how to iterate over an array of objects within a constructor function. I am currently taking in feedback on it, and will fine-tune and adjust it, before ultimately submitting a pull request.

Third, I have tried to help others learn as soon as I felt my own understanding was stable. When my cohort was working on Number Guesser, I helped several people find and fix syntax errors that tripped-up their otherwise-working code, and I helped some people understand that if we want to change any values from the original ones when the page loads we have to do so in an event listener. When we were working on Static Comp 2, I helped several people fix wonky flexbox behaviour so that their cards would row-fill from the left. While working on 2DoBox-Pivot, I tried to help my group partner understand how the original jQuery worked and how my proposed adjustments would fix some of the problems while maintaining as many of the original design choices as possible. In these last weeks, I have also gone over Direwolf and Sphinx with some of my cohort-mates who were having trouble completing one or two tests.

For the next module, I intend to contribute more to the Turing community, by pairing as much as possible with the incoming cohort, and by leading meditation sessions.
