# (Alexander Rau) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I really set out to learn the material.  Computers are not something that I've had a lot of access to, and, thus, programming is never something I thought I would have the opportunity to do.  I was really excited to get this opportunity, and I was not going to waste it.  Learning-wise, I decided I was not going to worry about whether or not I understood the concepts or the code right away, my gameplan was to act on as much of the advice that I received from people who have been through this Mod previously as I could and just make sure to, at a base-level, just put in the hours.  This method really worked for me, as I definitely feel I have a good handle on HTML, CSS, and, my biggest struggle, JS. The most helpful advice I got from upper mod-ers was to pair often, and I did that.  I attacked that pairing calendar several times a week, and made sure I was DM-ing anoyone I signed up with at least a day in advance.  I also got a lot out of my mentor, with whom I have weekly meetings, and I scheduled with Pat when he was available, as well.  I made sure, in my meetings with my mentor, that I was not afraid to ask any questions and express any concerns or thoughts I had about the work I was doing.  I also apporached pairing with this attitude, as well.  Outside of pairings and mentors, I aproached this learning process as if I were exercising a muscle: the only way to get better is put in the reps.  I believe all of this has helped me greatly, as I have turned in all of my projects in a state where I was proud of the finished product, and I also feel like I have a much better handle on the material than I did when I started.  For me, my progress from then to now is palpable.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here are all of the solo projects I completed this Mod, including: Number Guesser and all 3 Static Comp assignments:

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was my first major assignment, besides the basic, introductory website I had to create in the pre-mod work.  This introduced us to using JS (specifically vanilla), and it was also my first time recreating a page from a comp using CSS.  In this project, my code would generaste a random number between 1 and 100, and the user can submit a guess in the input field.  Then, the computer would tell them if they were too low or high from the randomly generated number, and the user would keep submitting guesses until they guess the number.  In my game, I put in contingencies for if the user guessed outside of 1-100 or typing in something that was not a number at all.

Evaluation comments:

- be sure to give proper indentation for my HTML

- review JS for refoactoring possibilities (for example: I had a particularly long "if" statement)

- be nice to myself!
