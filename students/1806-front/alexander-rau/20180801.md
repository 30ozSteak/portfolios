## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I really set out to learn the material.  Computers are not something that I've had a lot of access to, and, thus, programming is never something I thought I would have the opportunity to do.  I was really excited to get this opportunity, and I was not going to waste it.  Learning-wise, I decided I was not going to worry about whether or not I understood the concepts or the code right away, my gameplan was to act on as much of the advice that I received from people who have been through this Mod previously as I could and just make sure to, at a base-level, just put in the hours.  This method really worked for me, as I definitely feel I have a good handle on HTML, CSS, and, my biggest struggle, JS. The most helpful advice I got from upper mod-ers was to pair often, and I did that.  I attacked that pairing calendar several times a week, and made sure I was DM-ing anoyone I signed up with at least a day in advance.  I also got a lot out of my mentor, with whom I have weekly meetings, and I scheduled with Pat when he was available, as well.  I made sure, in my meetings with my mentor, that I was not afraid to ask any questions and express any concerns or thoughts I had about the work I was doing.  I also apporached pairing with this attitude, as well.  Outside of pairings and mentors, I aproached this learning process as if I were exercising a muscle: the only way to get better is put in the reps.  I believe all of this has helped me greatly, as I have turned in all of my projects in a state where I was proud of the finished product, and I also feel like I have a much better handle on the material than I did when I started.  For me, my progress from then to now is palpable.
