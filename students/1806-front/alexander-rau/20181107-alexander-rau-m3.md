# (Alexander Rau) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to really learn React, especially considering how difficult Weatherly was for me from Mod 2.  In this Mod, I wanted to keep challenging myself and making sure I did not get complacent.  Thankfully, the workload made this very easy to do.  I feel like, now, I have a very in-depth understanding of React, and Redux, as well as my being able to successfully implement React Router.  Also, I am much more comfortable with async JavaScript and can effectively use this functionality when needed.  This Mod really put me through my paces, and I made sure that I used Git Rebase workflow and implemented Redux-thunks, even though they weren't necessarily required, so that I could get the hang of both.  I was able to accomplish this successfully, and I feel I am a much better programmer for it (I love Rebase and Redux-thunks!).  I have also been able to really up my TDD ability, and I feel I can way more competently test React apps with Enzyme and Jest.  I feel like, at the end of this Mod, I now have the ability to build projects/Apps that I can be proud of (I am proud of my solo Binary Challenge, especially!).

## B: Individual Work & Projects
Here is an overview of the 2 solo projects I completed this Mod: Headcount 2.0 and Bread & Roses (Binary Challenge project):

Headcount 2.0
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/raualex/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

This project required us to build a React app that printed out cards with data from a group of school districts in Colorado.  The cards had to be able to be clicked, which would highlight them, and bring them to the top of the screen for comparision.  HAving two cards up top would also render a comparison card, showing the average and ratio between the two schools.  This project was not formally assessed or graded, but it was an excellent exercise in warming up our React chops, and getting in the swing of React OOP and passing imformation from Component to Component.

Evaluation Comments: N/A (this project was not eval'ed, we just did a group discussion in class)

Evaluation Score: N/A

This project was my final assessment for Mod 3.  This is the second project we did that implemented Redux, and I also pushed myself to implement Redux-thunks, thus making it so I did not have to make a single async fetch request in any of my components (this was awesome!).  In this project, I really got into a sweet groove with mocking out functions and, subsequently, was able to robustly test my App.  This made my App super strong, and I am proud of the finished product.  Being able to use Redux as a one source of truth, again, helped make React better to use, and I was also able to further hone my knowledge of React Router and async "await" syntax.

## C: Group Work & Projects
Projects
Here is an overview of the one partner project I completed this Mod, SWAPIbox, and the one 3-person group project: Movie Tracker:

SWAPIbox

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project was our first tryout of asynchronous JavaScript, with which we opted to use the ES7 async "await" syntax.  We also implemented React Router for the first time.  In this project, we had to follow the prescribed Iterations, in order.  This cause us to implement React Router last.  This was a big challenge, as React Router is best written first.  Writing it last cause us to have to refactor much of our App at the end of the project deadline.  Also, because we were using async JavaScript functions, we also had to write async testing, as well.  This helped me really start in on learning how to mock out functions and really plan out what I want to test.  Practice makes perfect for testing, and this project really helped.  This was also our first project to use PropTypes, which I found very helpful in keep my Components stable, by making sure they are always getting the correct type of props they need.  Also, with this project, we really started to use the Git Rebase workflow for the first time, and it made working on different things at the same time a whole lot easier.

Movie Tracker

This project was our first foray into using Redux, and it was the first project I have had so far in Turing with more than one partner.  We used the Redux store as a global source of truth, and we also had a Backend database built out so we could store user accounts, and records of which movie they had "favorited", so that this information would be available when they log in later.  I liked having a local Backend, and I also found Redux made React a whole lot easier to use.  No more confusion about passing info up and down from Components, and every time we make a change to the Redux global state tree, a re-render of connected components was guaranteed, so that helped greatly.  Redux DevTools also made it very easy to tell if Action creaters/Reducers were firing, and that made debugging issues easier to handle.  Git Rebase workflow really came in handy when we were divvy-ing up work between the three of us, and Merge conflicts were a lot less frequent than in past projects.  I also got better at mocking out functions for testing.  We also got more practice using React Router for this project.

## D: Community Participation
Playing a Part

During this Mod, I got even more into helping out in the Turing community.  I attended the Demo Comp at the beginning of the Mod, again, and I also participated in the Demo Night beforehand.  I helped with recording and production of another episode of the Turing podcast, and I am actively restarting the Pahlka Civic Tech Posse on campus.  I have events and group happenings already planned for the next inning, and I am starting a discussion among interested people to really build this posse into something that will continue after I leave here.  In addition to this, I have begun speaking with Turing alumni and starting to branch out with networking.  I hope to be able to get a job in the Civic Tech sphere.  I also am in talks with working on a side project with a member of the Backend program who just graduated.  We plan on building this out so we both can have something else impressive to put on our portfolios.  I also paired with members of my Mod, and the Mod 2 below me for help with their and my projects.
