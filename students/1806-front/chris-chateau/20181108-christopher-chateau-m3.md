 ## A: End of Module Assessment
 Although Mod 2 was extremely challenging, I leave as a significantly stronger and more well-rounded developer. I loved the game-time project and its hands-on/visual nature. I enjoyed all of the positive feedback I received from friends and family. My partner Jessica and I were very proud to win first place in our student code fair. With that said, the Complete-Me project was very difficult for me. Working only in the terminal manipulating data was a new experience and something I'm still getting comfortable doing. Mod 2 pushed me, and I feel accomplished to be graduating to Mod 3.
