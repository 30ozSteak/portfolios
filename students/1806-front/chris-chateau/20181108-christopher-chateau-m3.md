 ## A: End of Module Assessment
 
-Pass

I enjoyed mod 3 very much. It built on common themes throughout, which left me with a great sense of progression. All four projects, including Headcount, are featured in my Alumni Portfolio.
 
 ## B: Individual Work & Projects
 
 #### Marvelous
 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christopherchateau/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)
* [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-3/binary-challenge/chris/scores.md)
  
  I really enjoyed building my own site from scratch. It was my first experience being forced to make all project decisions without the help of collaborators and/or a specified project template. 

 #### Headcount
 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christopherchateau/headcount2.0)
* [GitHub Pages Link](https://christopherchateau.github.io/headcount2.0/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
  
  I approached Headcount as if it were a graded project. It was valuable practice that paid off throughout the mod. The site is hosted on Github pages.
  
 ## C: Group Projects
 
 ### Projects
 
 #### SWAPI-Box
 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christopherchateau/SWAPI-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)
* [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-3/swapi/chris-drake/scores.md)

 SWAPI-Box greatly enhanced my understanding of apiCalls and working with promises. I enjoyed working with Drake and was proud of our final product.
 
 #### Move-Tracker
 
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/christopherchateau/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [Evaluation Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-3/movie-tracker/chris-tobin-haley/scores.md)

This was my first time working in a group of three which lead us to utilize more of a 'divide and conquer' approach compared to previous projects. It was cool the way we were able to bring our various pieces of the puzzle together.

 ## D: Community Participation
 
 ### Playing a Part
 
 I collaborated with and assisted a number of my cohort-mates this module. I also co-led an array prototype review for the mod 2 students.
