-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
I received generally positive feedback on the majority of my end of module assessment.
I did struggle a little bit with refactoring the array prototype problem I was given, although I did manage to get the desired result.  I suspect that much of my struggle was due to nerves, as I strongly believe that I put a significant and sustained amount of effort in practicing array prototype methods daily, both in pairs and on my own.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects in this module consisted of two assignments, which consisted of building the following interfaces, each increasing in complexity:

#### 1. Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

#### 2. React Static Comp

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/ae-react-static-comp)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-starter-kit/tree/react-static-comp)

This project required me to rebuild a provided static comp using React. The primary goal of this (ungraded) assignment was to provide me with a structured, initial opportunity to become acquainted with React.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did my best to maintain a positive attitude and growth mindset among my classmates even when many people were stressed and cranky such as during the Complete Me project.  I encouraged people who expressed self-doubt to me and offered to help them when I thought I could be of assistance. Most importantly, I made it a top priority to treat everyone with respect and kindness and to ask questions in class that were relevant and that would help clarify fundamental concepts for myself and others.
