# Alexander Ela - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

1. To become more comfortable with not understanding programming concepts at first and to better prevent myself from sinking into panic or despair as a result of comparing myself to other classmates.

2. To develop more fluency with array prototype methods and with being more decisive with working in Javascript in general.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
I received generally positive feedback on the majority of my end of module assessment.
I did struggle a little bit with refactoring the array prototype problem I was given, although I did manage to get the desired result.  I suspect that much of my struggle was due to nerves, as I strongly believe that I put a significant and sustained amount of effort in practicing array prototype methods daily, both in pairs and on my own.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects in this module consisted of two assignments, which consisted of building the following interfaces, each increasing in complexity:

#### 1. HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

This assignment required me to create an app that allows users to compare Colorado school district data.

##### Evaluator: None
##### Evaluation: None
##### Evaluation Scores: None

#### 2. Disc Golf Guru (Self-directed final project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/disc-golf-guru)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

This project required me to rebuild a provided static comp using React. The primary goal of this (ungraded) assignment was to provide me with a structured, initial opportunity to become acquainted with React.

##### Evaluator: None
##### Evaluation: Comments
My evaluator's comments were mostly positive, with her saying that my README file was the best she had seen for this project.  She did recommend that I implement GitHub issues and Waffle.io to better demonstrate my organizational skills.  

##### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application uses the above technologies to a professional level. The evaluator has minimal recommendations for refactoring or design changes.

[10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

##### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

##### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async functionality.

##### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

##### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for undefined routes.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects in this module consisted of two assignments completed by groups of two, including myself and another classmate. These assignments consisted of building the following interfaces, each increasing in complexity:

#### 1. SWAPI Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

Create a playable game using HTML based on the classic arcade game, "Snake".

##### Students: Alexander Ela and Dina Caraballo
##### Evaluator: Christie Lynam
##### Evaluation: 
###### Comments:  Nice job!


##### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 6 iterations.

##### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### CSS/Design

- 3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

##### React Router

- 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

##### Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

##### Wireframes

- Pass - Developer team laid out their thinking using wireframes before building their project

##### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### README Updates

- Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running
  
### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) are using a rebase workflow, effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.


#### 2. Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This assignment required me and my partner to construct a weather application using React and drawing realtime weather data from the Weather Underground API.

##### Students: Alexander Ela, Alex Bruce, and Drake Bott
##### Evaluator: Will Mitchell
##### Evaluation: 
##### Specification Adherence

* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or 
  more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.
  
  [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

##### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

##### Testing

* 2 - Nearly all unit tests for Redux and React are in place. No attempt to test
  async functionality was made.

##### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the
  store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

##### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did my best to maintain a positive attitude and growth mindset among my classmates even when many people were stressed and cranky such as during the Complete Me project.  I encouraged people who expressed self-doubt to me and offered to help them when I thought I could be of assistance. Most importantly, I made it a top priority to treat everyone with respect and kindness and to ask questions in class that were relevant and that would help clarify fundamental concepts for myself and others.
