# Alexander Ela - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goals at the beginning of this module were as follows:
1. To become proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript fundamentals to the point where I felt comfortable practicing and experimenting with each on my own.
2. To gain an accurate sense of whether or not I could develop a genuine passion for certain areas of programming so that I can actually enjoy the job I eventually get.
