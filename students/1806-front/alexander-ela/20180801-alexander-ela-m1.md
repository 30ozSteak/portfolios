# Alexander Ela - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goals at the beginning of this module were as follows:
1. To become proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript fundamentals to the point where I felt comfortable practicing and experimenting with each on my own.
2. To gain an accurate sense of whether or not I could develop a genuine passion for certain areas of programming so that I can actually enjoy the job I eventually get.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 3

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects
The individual projects in this module consisted of the following:
1. **Number Guesser:**  An interactive game that allows users to try to guess a randomly generated number and lets users know if their guesses are too high, too low, correct, or invalid number.
2. **Static Comp Challenges 1, 2, & 3:** Three static comp challenges tasking students to recreate a different static comp, with each growing in complexity.


#### 1. Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/number-guesser/alexander-ela.md)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.  The application should have the following user interface components:  
* A button for clearing the input field
* A button that resets the game
* Display the userâ€™s most recent guess
* Display results and feedback:=
* The input field should only accept numerical entries, within the defined min and max range
* The application should display an error message if the guess is not a number (e.g. parseInt() returns NaN).
* The application should display an error if the guess is outside of the range of possible answers.
* The clear button should be disabled if there is nothing to clear.
* The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset.


##### Evaluator: Travis Rollins
##### Notes/What To Work On:

* Careful of margins and spacing in header for UI
* Next step: adding aria-labels to html buttons and inputs
* Careful of where you are using rems in your CSS.
    - experiment with pixels and percentages so you can hone in on the styles
* Great organization of javascript
* Keep working on refactoring repeated lines of code in your javascript
* Make sure to pass event as a parameter in event listener functions

##### Functional Expectations

* Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.   


##### COMP RECREATION / DESIGN
* Advanced Beginner  

##### HTML
* Proficient  

##### CSS
* Advanced Beginner  
* Proficient   

##### JS/jQuery
* Proficient  

##### Surprise and Delight (reminder: have fun!)
* Hot Fire

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
 
The group projects in this module consisted of three assignments completed by groups of two, consisting of myself and another classmate. These assignments consisted of building the following interfaces, each increasing in complexity:

1. **Linked List:**  A website that allows users to enter a website title and URL and posts submissions to a separate section.
2. **IdeaBox:**  A website that allows users to enter a website title and body and posts submissions to a separate section. Each submission generates its own unique ID for use in local storage and allows users to toggle a "quality" rating for each unique submission.
3. **2DoBox (IdeaBox Refactor/Pivot):**  A refactor of a previous student's version of IdeaBox. Final product includes a more polished code base and new features including a more intricate rating system, search feature, and more elegantly designed interface. 

#### 1. Linked List

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My contributions to the greater Turing community have been subtle but considered.  I'm introverted by nature and sometimes struggle with asking questions. However, I've consistently strived to be vocal in class when I don't understand a concept. This is both for my own benefit and for other students who may feel hesitant to ask questions themselves. When talking to other students I've made a consistent effort to be kind and supportive, as I very much realize that many students are feeling vulnerable in a fast-paced educational setting with material that is new to them.  Another way I've tried to contribute to the Turing community as a whole has been to take my learning very seriously and to consistently demonstrate through my actions, classroom etiquette, and study habits that I am wholeheartedly committed to my studies at Turing. It is my hope that my demeanor has helped to motivate or inspire others during my time here thus far. Furthermore, it is my hope that as I gain confidence in my programming skills in future modules, I will feel more confident in my ability to offer specific guidance to my classmates and to other Turing students with whom I come into contact.
