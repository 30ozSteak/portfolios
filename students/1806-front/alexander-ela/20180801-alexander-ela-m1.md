# Alexander Ela - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goals at the beginning of this module were as follows:
1. To become proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript fundamentals to the point where I felt comfortable practicing and experimenting with each on my own.
2. To gain an accurate sense of whether or not I could develop a genuine passion for certain areas of programming so that I can actually enjoy the job I eventually get.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects
The individual projects in this module consisted of the following:
1. **Number Guesser:**  An interactive game that allows users to try to guess a randomly generated number and lets users know if their guesses are too high, too low, correct, or invalid number.
2. **Static Comp Challenges 1, 2, & 3:** Three static comp challenges tasking students to recreate a different static comp, with each growing in complexity.


#### 1. Number Guesser

* [Evaluation](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1806/mod-1/number-guesser/alexander-ela.md)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.  The application should have the following user interface components:  
* A button for clearing the input field
* A button that resets the game
* Display the user’s most recent guess
* Display results and feedback
* The input field should only accept numerical entries, within the defined min and max range
* The application should display an error message if the guess is not a number (e.g. parseInt() returns NaN)
* The application should display an error if the guess is outside of the range of possible answers
* The clear button should be disabled if there is nothing to clear
* The reset button should be disabled if there is nothing to reset

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
 
The group projects in this module consisted of three assignments completed by groups of two, consisting of myself and another classmate. These assignments consisted of building the following interfaces, each increasing in complexity:

1. **Linked List:**  A website that allows users to enter a website title and URL and posts submissions to a separate section.
2. **IdeaBox:**  A website that allows users to enter a website title and body and posts submissions to a separate section. Each submission generates its own unique ID for use in local storage and allows users to toggle a "quality" rating for each unique submission.
3. **2DoBox (IdeaBox Refactor/Pivot):**  A refactor of a previous student's version of IdeaBox. Final product includes a more polished code base and new features including a more intricate rating system, search feature, and more elegantly designed interface.

##### Student: Alexander Ela & Ashton Bailey
##### Evaluator: Travis Rollins
##### Notes/What To Work On:
* Making sure both sides are making commits
* Keep working on making more commits and creating new feature branches
* Add hover states to buttons
* Make sure save button is disabled when inputs are empty
* Great structure of css and easy to ready through
* Keep experimenting with drying up code and using more grouping
* Experiment using pixels/percentages instead of using decimals for ems/rems
* Nice job breaking out global variables, event listeners, and functions
* Be consistent about breaking out functions from event listeners
* Good job using constructor function
* Continue to dry up repeated lines of code including breaking out the appending card functions into one function
* Experiment using array prototype methods over for loops
* Start using jQuery in your next project


## Functional Expectations
* Novice  Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.


## HTML

## Accessibility
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style
* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.


##### CSS

##### Structure of Code
* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

##### Implementation
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.


##### JAVASCRIPT

##### Data Types
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

##### Conditional Logic
* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

##### Functions & Scope
* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

##### Arrays
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

##### Objects & Prototypes
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

##### DOM Manipulation
* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

##### Style
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


##### GIT & GITHUB

##### Git
* Novice  Can use commits and can articulate what a commit is and why we use them. Makes large, infrequent commits directly to master branch.

##### Github
* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration
* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab
* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.



#### 3. 2DoBox (Idea Box Refactor/Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexanderela/2DoBox--Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My contributions to the greater Turing community have been subtle but considered.  I'm introverted by nature and sometimes struggle with asking questions. However, I've consistently strived to be vocal in class when I don't understand a concept. This is both for my own benefit and for other students who may feel hesitant to ask questions themselves. When talking to other students I've made a consistent effort to be kind and supportive, as I very much realize that many students are feeling vulnerable in a fast-paced educational setting with material that is new to them.  Another way I've tried to contribute to the Turing community as a whole has been to take my learning very seriously and to consistently demonstrate through my actions, classroom etiquette, and study habits that I am wholeheartedly committed to my studies at Turing. It is my hope that my demeanor has helped to motivate or inspire others during my time here thus far. Furthermore, it is my hope that as I gain confidence in my programming skills in future modules, I will feel more confident in my ability to offer specific guidance to my classmates and to other Turing students with whom I come into contact.
