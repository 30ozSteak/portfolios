## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this mod was to problem solve independently, and more often. I chose this goal because I wanted to build my confidence in the skills I've gained. It's been a tough haul, but I'm happy that I chose and achieved this goal.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

According to instructors, I passed all end of module assessments.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module, we were assigned one individual project.

### Projects
* Palette Picker
* Take Home Code Challenge
-----------------------

#### Palette Picker

* https://github.com/djcaraballo/PalettePicker
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html

For this project, we were required to build an application that generated random palettes using Express, Node.js, Knex and Vanilla Javascript.

## Student: Dina
## Evaluator: None
## Notes/What To Work On:

- This project was ungraded.

-----------------------

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
* BYOB
* Teller
-----------------------

This module, I were assigned two group projects.

#### BYOB - Grouped with Tim Garrity and Drake Bott
## Evaluator: Will Mitchell
## Notes/What To Work On:

- Nice job!

* https://github.com/djcaraballo/BYOB
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html

For this project, we were required to build a custom backend. We chose to build a backend for an application that took ingredients in the user's fridge and matched them to recipes.

-----------------------

#### Teller - Grouped with Nick Dambrosio, Daniel Mulitauopele, and Autumn Martin
## Evaluators: Leta Keane, Will Mitchell, Amy Holt, Cory Westerfield

* https://github.com/DanielMulitauopele/teller
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/capstone.html

For this project, we were required to build a application designed by the group. We built both front and back ends for this project.

-----------------------

## D: Professional Skills
During mod 4, we were required to attend several professional development sessions designed to prepare us for working as software developers; help us to continue developing our own narrative for job-hunting; aid us in negotiation; and, prepare us for job-hunting outside of Turing.

-----------------------

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I led a gear up session with a team in my cohort. We focused on practical skills that would benefit us in the job hunt and in our work as developers.

# Self-Reflection Rubric

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.


## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.


## D: Professional Development

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.


## E: Community Participation

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.
They build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive
positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
