## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Each of these projects increased in difficulty and time required to complete. As I progressed through them, I learned a little more about time management and balancing the demands of these and of the paired projects. The biggest non-technical takeaway was being able to communicate with my partner about the time I needed to dedicate to my own projects.
