## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for this mod were focused towards establishing a lifestyle that would fit in well with the curriculum. I didn't know enough about code to set a focus within the curriculum itself. I set out to try a few different methods to organize my time at home and at school. I tried to integrate pomodoros, time boxing, and a set eating/sleeping schedule to keep myself balanced. I was successful with pomodoros. I found a Chrome app that suited my needs and was simple enough to use. Time boxing was not as helpful. I like to use Google calendar to plan ahead, and time boxing seems more appropriate to use in the moment. The set eat/sleep schedule was by far the best tool for getting into a routine for school. I gave myself an anchor for each day that I could fall back on as the stress waxed and waned.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass, with some notes for improvement moving into the next mod.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Each of these projects increased in difficulty and time required to complete. As I progressed through them, I learned a little more about time management and balancing the demands of these and of the paired projects. The biggest non-technical takeaway was being able to communicate with my partner about the time I needed to dedicate to my own projects.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

It took a couple of weeks for me to open up and insert myself into public discussion. I represented our cohort in the bake-off. I will be sitting in the Turing booth at the Ethiopian Cultural Festival this weekend. I went to almost all of the wrap ups. I went to one Health and Wellness Posse meeting. I participated in the Significant Other Meetup during the mod. I voted in the Code Fair. I plan to attend the Demo Night and graduation for Mod4 folks. I hope to do more next mod.
