## A: End of Module Assessment

PASS


## B: Individual Work & Projects

These projects demonstrate my indepent work ethic and discipline. From the beginning of the inning to the end my work flow and confidence made a complete turn for the better.

#### (HeadCount)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jstewart3313/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount is an application to compare school data. This was our first solo project that I was not confident in writing most of the code but completed the project to a point that I was truly happy with.

#### (Boat Buddy)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jstewart3313/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Boat Buddy was a project I completed at the end of the inning. This code was written through TDD and the entire process was done with confidence in myself as a developer. I had some early terminal problems but was able to work through that and still deliver an MVP with *meaning*.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These projects pushed me to collaborate as an introvert. Working with teammates always adds an extra challenge of communication and understanding which I think is a learning experience every time it is done.
