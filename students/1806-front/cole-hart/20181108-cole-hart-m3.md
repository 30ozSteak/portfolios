# Cole Hart - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, we learned more about React, were introduced to React Router and Redux, and mastered TDD for React and Redux. We also learned about curried functions, asynchronous testing, thunks, sagas and epics, and rebase workflow with git.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

We completed two individual projects this mod, Headcount 2.0 and our final Binary Challenge. HeadCount 2.0, our first project of the mod, was not evaluated and was a pretty rough deeper exploration of React concepts. Allyship is the name of my final binary challenge. I completed it in two and a half days and have an excellent testing base for next steps and expansions

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

#### Allyship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/allyship)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)

From the spec: This project will challenge you to use the technology you’ve become familiar with over the course of Mod 3, as well as force you to work inside some constraints. Everyone will be working with (at least) one API, and one audience.

My assigned API was NewsAPI.org and my audience was activists. I ended up making an issue specific news-retrieval app with plans to expand for the user to be able to save news articles to their device using local storage and to add a search bar for user-generated API calls.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two group projects this mod, SWAPI-box, a paired project, and Movie Tracker, a three person group project. SWAPI-box was a project to export React Router and really focus on TDD, using the Star Wars API to populate cards. Movie Tracker was a similar project that introduced us to Redux architecture and testing, querying THe Movie DataBase API and using a backend to store user credentials and authenticate them for sign in.

#### SWAPI-box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/swapibox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

From the spec: For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

#### Movie Tracker / WesTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/movie-tracker-frontend)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

From the spec: This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies.

This repository will serve as your "backend", allowing you to connect to Postgres. You'll need to set up a separate client-side application (use create-react-app), to sit alongside this one. Do not put that project in the same repository as this one, save yourself a headache.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod, I supported individual Turing students who were struggling with how the US political climate was affecting their sense of well-being in the lead up to mid term elections. In that vein, I presented a lightning talk on Trans Rights and Intersectional Spheres of Influence in the wake of one of the most violent and troubling weeks in recent history.
