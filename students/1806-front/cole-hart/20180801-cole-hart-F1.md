# Cole Hart - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to translate my knowledge of Ruby and Rails from the first two mods of Turing's back end program into JavaScript and jQuery prowess. I also wanted to get more comfortable with HTML and CSS, specifically grid and flexbox. I achieved all of that and had fun along the way.

#### LinkedList

* [My LinkedList GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

A small application which, in it’s simplest form, should have the following:

- Two input fields  
  - One for the title of the bookmark  
  - One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
- One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
- A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:  
  - The title of the bookmark  
  - The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)  
  - A button to “Mark as Read”  
  - A button to “Remove” the bookmark

### Partner Feedback:

This was by far the best partnered project I have done so far at Turing, and for this great experience I thank Cole! The amount of professionalism and empaty Cole offers is amazing. Cole introduced me to new tools,  like waffle.io which definitely helped me take my performance to the next level! I truly am grateful to have worked with Cole and know the experiences I had in this pairing will continue to resonate with my as I continue my career as a web developer. Cole has a great vision and foresight as to what we were doing and how we could get further. There were times when you recognized we were stagnate or burned out, and that recognization really helped us. Rather than just attempting to push through, which usually leads to poor code. Your awareness was amazing and I hope you continue to  use these characteristics as I know it will make you a great developer and leader.


#### IdeaBox

* [My IdeaBox GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

#### Assessment Notes:


##### Notes/What To Work On:

## Notes/What To Work On:

### HTML
* use aria labels on inputs

### CSS
* consider moving element selectors to the top
* Love those organizational comments
* consider using classes more

### JS
* Great style and naming conventions
* Use constructor functions!
* Separate the data model from the markup - the way things are displayed will always change
* Think about having a qualities array

### Git
* Nice work!

## Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## HTML

## Accessibility

* Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

## Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

## Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

## Arrays

* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

## Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style

* Exceptional Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.
* Exceptional Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers.

## Github

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.
* Exceptional Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.


## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.


## PAIRING

## Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.

## TERMINOLOGY

## Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
* Exceptional Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology. Developer is confident and comfortable speaking to and answering questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

    

### Partner Feedback:

Hey Cole, you did a great job with talking things out while solving problems. I like your thought process and approach to problem solving. You worked pretty quickly which was impressive to see. Even though you were faster than me, you were willing to slow down and explain some things to me so that we were on the same page as partners. I appreciated this! You also took a very organized/methodical approach to assignments on the project (using Waffle.io), and that was helpful. I would say that you could probably take more breaks. Also, we probably could have done a better job of designating specific tasks on Waffle.io, so we both got our own assigned things to do. Although the driver-navigator pair programming approach was helpful as well sometimes. My biggest feedback here is take breaks and take care of yourself. 

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [My 2DoBox-Pivot GitHub URL](https://github.com/colehart/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Do you remember that project IdeaBox?…

We thought they were pretty great, but, we think it’s time to pivot those projects over to something we like to call 2DoBox.

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

- good use of ARIA
- HTML is really tidy and clean
- a couple properties in CSS aren't really doing much and could be removed
- JS is very tidy, good job really hitting the 8-line function rule
- good at talking through and speaking to the code

### Partner Feedback:

I really appreciated how Cole was very open to discussion and conversation, we were both adept in talking out our code and that made collaboration much easier.  I loved how Cole was farther ahead of me in JavaScript, which put me in a position to learn a lot, and he was very helpful in teaching me things I did not know, bringing me up to speed.  I am a much better coder now, after having worked with Cole. The only coaching feedback that I would have for Cole would apply equally to myself.  We both had a propensity for refactoring, and then re-refactoring our code, and not really calling it done at any point.  This is a very nice "problem" to have, as it made our code very clean and functional, but I feel like we could have saved ourselves some stress if, in the future, we agree on a finite done date that neither of us are allowed to go beyond. 


## D: Professional Skills

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I supported Dina and Mark as the SAB Reps for our mod early on by telling them what it entails. I also participated in the Significant Others of Turing event and interviewed two candidates for the Student Success Coordinator with Dina at Joanne's bequest. I also helped others in class as I could, walked through mythical creatures with James and Kevin one day, and participated in three PD sessions.
