# Kevin Simpson - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this modules were simple: I wanted continue to expand my understanding of React, become comfortable with handling API calls and associated data, and gain a firm hold of Redux and Router. I feel like I accomplished all of these goals. While I believe I'm still learning to navigate and use Router in conjunction with dynamic state, I feel that I have a pretty solid grasp of Redux and the philosophy behind it. I'm extremely comfortable with React at this point and am moving onto working with React Native on the side.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This Mod's project load was extremely challenging as the mod progressed. Overall, I'm fine with the work that I produced on solo projects, but wish I would have had more time to work on the binary challenge or that I would have had the good sense to pair down what I was trying to do. My HeadCount, however, was extremely solid.

#### (HeadCount 2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/relasine/headcount2.0)
* [Deployed Project](https://relasine.github.io/headcount2.0)
* [Project Specs](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

This project was to make a card-based data comparison application focusing on test scores for Colorado school districts. Data is provided in a file. This data must be cleaned and deployed via React.

#### (Binary Challenge)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/relasine/empire-state-univ-dorm-board)
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)

This project acts as a culmination of all the skills learned in Mod 3, combining React with Router, Redux, and REST API usage. Students are given a random API and end user and are tasked with building an application to fit both.

(evaluation comments)
* Redux implementation is fine, but could have been used to store api data to keep from having to make repeat API calls.
* Avoid writing helper functions as JavaScript classes; this makes them more difficult to test.
* Use spyOn instead of jest.fn() reassignment to see if methods are called
* Pull out vestigial code prior to evals

(evaluation scores)
* 4 for spec adherence and Router. 3 for Redux. 2 for testing.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### SWAPIBox

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/relasine/SWAPIBox)

* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project was to use the Star Wars API to make a series of nested API calls and to then display the data on the page for users to browse through and favorite. Favorites are stored in local storage. Utilizes React and React Router.

(evaluation comments)
* GREAT WORK!!!

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/aweissman11/frontend-movie-tracker)
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Movie tracker is a web application designed to allow the user to create a collection of their favorite films. Users can search films by title, browse them via a combination of genre, rating, year of release, and sort them via a series of parameters. Movie data is populated via The Movie Database API. Account handling is done via a local backend built in Express. Introduces and requires Redux with associated testing. 

(evaluation comments)
* The code for suggest() was too verbose and it ran slowly
* Figure out why the localHost testing wasn't running

(feedback to me)
* Be mindful of font size. 
* Make sure that users can navigate the page without having to use the back/forward buttons

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I served as a member of SAB this mod, ran a short workshop on CSS transitions for MOD2, and made myself available to fellow classmates for help when possible.
