# ADAM RICE - M1 Portfolio - 1610

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to reinforce the items that I felt comfortable with after spending 6 weeks with 1608 but also to improve the areas I was lacking. Specifically, I needed to improve my ability to solve difficult problems when building an application and not giving up when the solution did not immediately come to me. This would involve visiting the CodeWars site on a regular basis so that I could become more comfortable with the tools that javascript offers. Also, I intended to write several small applications in the first month that were not part of a Turing project or homework assignment. In regards to CSS I was also excited to become more confident in manipulating sections of the page and truly understanding how I was doing so, in order to help my classmates when they had issues. Lastly, I wanted to become a better member of the 1610 cohort than I had been while part of 1608. This would involve being in class everyday, being available when my classmates had questions, and asking the instructors questions when I felt I was not understanding a lesson.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluator: Robbie
### Notes
* Good with changing the height of the form container after adding more input fields
* Struggled with the default value, saw some slight syntax errors (between assignment and equivalence), made a function that didn't return any values (so the result was NaN), but eventually caught all of these and got the default number of diners to work
* Completed phase one and started phase two
* Good use of variable assignments and jQuery selection was practiced well
### Scores
### Progression/Completion
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
### JavaScript Style
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
### Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
### Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## B: Individual Work & Projects

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

* [View on github.](https://github.com/adam-rice/numberGuesser)
* [View the assignment requirements.](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

A number guessing game created by Kenia Farias and Adam Rice using vanilla javaScript. This applicaton was the first project of the Front-End program at the Turing School of Software & Design.

#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### UX/UI Expectations
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.
#### Functional Expectations
* 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
#### Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Feedback from Kenia: Adam thank you for taking on a mentor role and really guiding the project in the right direction. Also, thanks for letting me struggle instead of just giving me the answer right away. It really helped me to become more comfortable with writing out code. I think our project worked out really well because of our initial DTR and our constant communication. I also became a lot more comfortable pushing and pulling changes from and to gitHub. I feel like there were some parts of the project where you had a great idea and went with it, but I would have liked to go over what some of the changes were a little more in depth. I really think our overall teamwork was great and I learned a lot!

#### Bookmark List

* [View on github.](https://github.com/adam-rice/Bookmark-List)
* [View the assignment requirements.](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

A list to store pages you want to read! Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery a user can create a list of URLs they would like to revisit. The application is able to remove read links, mark links as read, and display the appropriate counts for these categories. This application does not persist in local storage.

#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### Functional Expectations
* 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
#### Fundamental JavaScript Style
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
#### Workflow
* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
#### HTML Style
* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
#### CSS Style
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Feedback: Had no partner.

#### IdeaBox

* [View on github.](https://github.com/adam-rice/Idea-Box)
* [View the assignment requirements.](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

An application to store your ideas. Created by Chaz-Mykl Gormley and Adam Rice using JavaScript, jQuery, LocalStorage, JSON, HTML & CSS.

#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### Specification Adherence
* 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions. well done, included some test coverage.
#### HTML Style
* 3.5 -- leveraging an H1 for the title rather than just span tags, otherwise nicely done
#### CSS Style
* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
#### JavaScript Style
* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
#### Workflow
* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. could have had a more equal number of commits from both team members
#### Collaboration
* 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

Feedback from Chaz: Adam and I worked together on "Idea Box" , which introduced 'localStorage' into the JS/jQuery fold. Overall the experience was ideal - we planned properly and were able to break out work into segments, allowing us both to have a 'hands-on' experience. Adam's grasp of JS exceeds my own, and there were points in the project where he blazed ahead and got a lot done in that department - however, he made sure to walk me through, and ensure that I could explain the logic/how-to, in those moments. As we move forward as a cohort, I look forward to working with Adam further.

#### Game Time

* [View the assignment requirements.](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Frogger in Javascript! This game was built by Jon Willemain and Adam Rice as a pair project in Module 1 at the Turing School.
