# Adam Rice - Module 2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I wanted to set a strong foundation regarding React.js, APIs, Accessibility, Aria, Sass, and webpack. I also strived to expand my professional network and reach out to developers that are currently working in the industry. Lastly, I wanted to set an example for the 1610 cohort by attending every class lecture and consistently being at Gusto early and leaving late.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser in React

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/React_Number_Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-in-react.html)

A number guessing game built using react.js. Player can guess a number between 1-100 and the output will alert the player if their guess is too low, high, or correct. If the player guesses correctly they can immediately play a new game clicking a Reset Game button.

Assessment Instructor: Jhun

Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

Fundamental JavaScript/React Style

* 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## C: Group Work & Projects

### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adam-rice/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

An application that stores a list of todos, can be sorted based on importance, contains a search bar, is accessible, has a character limit, and is built using ES6 and Sass.

Instructor: Meeka

Minor Issues
* Completed: Search doesn't work when toggled when you're there. (not a huge issue at all)
* One axecore violation when completed todos are shown because the li that was display none is still present and a new li is created for the completed todo

Specification Adherence

* 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

Accessibility

* 3.5 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.

User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Utilization of es6

* 4 - Developer has used more than one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature(s) does/do and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of the es5 style in their code left in the codebase.

Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Feedback

From Devin: I really liked working on the 2DoBox project with you. I think you're really good at staying calm when things break and I can tell you really like to think through a problem before you try and implement it. We had originally planned to do a lot of the work together, but we ended up working on different parts of the project and combining our efforts to get it done. I actually think this worked out really well, especially since we did have a few opportunities to work together to solve some smaller problems and bugs.
