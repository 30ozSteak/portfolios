## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

### PreWork
Deliverables:
- Write up a summary of the pieces you completed.
- Looking back on the pre-work, what did you find useful in terms of preparation for the material covered in Module 3? What do you wish there had been more/less of?

* [Wes Bos JavaScript30](https://github.com/apsitos/JS30)
  * This was a fun way to review JavaScript and to learn new ways to use the library. I don't know that I can do any of it on my own, but I'm glad I have these to look back on and review.
* [Wes Bos Learn Redux](https://github.com/apsitos/LearnRedux)
  * I enjoyed getting to work with Redux before we got instruction on it. However, I didn't really understand what we were doing because he moves pretty fast. I think that now we've done a project in it, I could go back and do this again and solidify what I learned.
* [NodeWork]
  * The Express.js work was awful. The only way to accomplish this assignment was to watch the videos, which felt like cheating. I did not find this to be a useful part of pre-work at all. It was interesting that it all had to be done in the terminal, and I appreciated getting more experience with that, but I think that might have been the only real benefit.

### UI/UX Homework

### Walker Texas RangerBox

*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/walker-texas-rangerbox.html)

This was a solo project to use React and API calls. I definitely struggled more than I feel I should have at this point, but I also did not ask for help as soon as I should have to help me progress.

Student: Annastasia Psitos
Notes: A bit light on the feature implementation as we ran into some bugs that prevented all the functionality from falling into place.  Good work trying to test the features and components that were in place, and solid effort on design though not 100% polished.

#### Specification Adherence

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

#### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

####Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
