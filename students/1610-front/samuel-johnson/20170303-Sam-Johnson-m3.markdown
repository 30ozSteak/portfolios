## B: Individual Work & Projects

<!-- I was excited to spend this module really focused on setting a solid foundation for React and think I accomplished that. I spent a lot of individual work time studying different resources around React and taking tutorials through Code Academy. I think, as a result, the final code base for my individual Weatherly project was solid and represented a very solid understanding of React foundations - something that Meeka said she was impressed by during my project assessment.  

I am excited to push myself further in Mod3 to master more of the complex aspects of React and to get comfortable with React Native as well. -->

<!-- This was our mid-mod assessment - done as a take home exercise. I thought this was a good exercise to keep me in the game during break and as a warm-up for Firebae (which essentially kicked off right after this was done).  While I think there was some room for improvement with regard to my JS/React style, I think the project demonstrated my strong understanding of both. -->

# C: Group Work & Projects

## Projects

<!-- I really enjoyed learning React this mod.  While I wish I had been able to push my learning a bit more during this time, I think I have a really strong foundation with React and am excited to push myself in the next mod to get much more comfortable with lifecycles, router and working with Firebase and APIs. -->

### Feedback for Me
From Bekah (my partner): I worked on the redux weather app with Sam. Sam was an awesome partner to have on a really intense project. He is a vary hard worker, positive and honest, and won’t stop working until the task is done.

Sam and I paired quite a bit on this project. Sam is great at pairing. He listens, explains his thoughts very clearly, and is positive if things get hard.

The only advice or constructive criticism I could give you is to be able to assign work out if you have too much on your plate.

I am glad we got to work together this mod, you are a very strong developer!


### RemEMBER

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

<!-- This was a tough project to start after two weeks off.  Both Elijah and I struggled at first to untangle pretty messy code and, after a few days, decided we wanted to try to refactor a large portion of the code base to utilize closures within the main application. This took a bit of setup time but, after that was done, we flew through the other components/features required.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to push myself to learn something new on this project and think it set a good tone for the mod. -->

#### Feedback to Me
From Mike (partner): Working with Sam on the Ember project was great. Tackling foreign concepts with a hard worker and great problem solver was a good experience and made the project fly by almost too easily. Sam made himself available to pair often and was easy to communicate with about code.

One piece of advice is practice patience. I'm guilty of it as well but at times Sam was quick to smash out a potential solution on the keys when it would have probably better served us to stop and talk about the approach before putting "pen to the paper".  

Overall a solid programmer and would gladly work with him again. Hopefully next time on a more exciting project.


## D: Professional Skills

## Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

<!-- I really enjoyed this session and it was one I needed following the Presidential Election.  One of the things that is most appealing to me about Turing is the social justice orientation of the program.  While I think there is more that can be done to encourage a social justice orientation within the curriculum, I appreciated this session following our break.  It gave me a bit more time to work out some of my thoughts out loud and to develop a more of an understanding of what I need to do as a privileged, white, male in the age of Drumpf. -->

#### Automation

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/automation.markdown)

<!-- I was unable to attend this Gear Up - due to illness - but I did read through the materials and found them interesting. I have done similar activities in the past and found them helpful. -->

#### Universal Basic Income

* [Gear Up URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gearup/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

<!-- Grit is a concept I am very familiar with and have spent a lot of time thinking about during my previous life at Teach For America - Grit is a core competency we look for when interviewing potential Corps Members and I have interviewed at least 100 of them and looked for it. I've also spent a lot of personal time and energy reflecting on Grit and developing it as something core to who I am and how I approach the things that are most important to me.  

The reason why I choose a mission-oriented boot camp and why I will seek employment with a mission-oriented organization/company after Turing is because of my need to be passionate about what my work is moving towards.  I have been a part of a social justice movement for my entire professional life and plan to continue to do so and my understanding and commitment to Grit is a big piece of that. -->

# E: Feedback and Community Participation

## Giving Feedback

#### Mike (project partner)
I really enjoyed working with you on the Ember project, Mike.  It was one of the more difficult projects to figure out - in terms of my learning curve - but I thought we had a good pairing dynamic that got us through it very effectively.  I think we were both frustrated at times but think we had a mutual understanding/respect that kept us ultimately on track and able to kick out a very solid project.

My only constructive feedback is actually similar to yours - just to be aware of ideas/a different direction than the one you are on when driving pair coding. I think we are similar in this way - we learn by exploring - but figured I’d mention it since there were a few times where I didn’t feel like you were totally internalizing the idea/direction I was trying to propose.  

 I would gladly partner up with you again and hope we get that opportunity on a more substantial project in Mod4.  You are a great programmer and teammate.

#### Bekah (project partner)
I really enjoyed working with you on the redux project.  It was a really though project with a new framework but I thought you were a really great partner to pair with and figure it out.  I appreciated your patience and willingness to just sit down and figure stuff out together while being super positive, patient, and hard working.

My only piece of constructive feedback is to be more focal when discussing how the group is going to break up work.  Part of this project was focused on doing individual work - and using git workflow to manage - and, at times, I felt a bit pressured to direct people on what to do when I think it could have been better if people just volunteered and/or spoke up about what they wanted to work on. I think I probably could have been better about bringing that out in people but thought I’d mention it.

I think you are a great partner, Bekah, and would gladly work on another project with you!

#### Anna (project partner)
My feedback is primarily focused on constructive feedback from the redux project we worked on together with Bekah.

I think the main tension/frustration I felt - especially early on in the project - was what I perceived to be a lack of commitment to contributing to the codebase we were building.  I know you had commitments that kept you from pairing with Bekah and I during the first few afternoon/nights of the project but my expectation was that you’d be making up for it by contributing to the codebase at other times.  This was a project that had specific goals around git workflow and divide and conquer and I didn’t get the impression that you were interested in working on the project unless it was paired - something that wasn’t possible for the first few days because of your schedule. As a result, I thought the workload/contributions from the group were pretty unbalanced - especially early on - and I think it created tension.

I think my main piece of feedback, based on the above, is that I think your locus of control can sometimes be a little too externally oriented.  At times, I felt like your assumption was that we all needed to pair to get anything done and that, if we weren’t together, you weren’t going to contribute.  From the perspective of a team member, this was frustrating to feel like I was put in a position where I had to spend more of my time picking up the slack.  For example, I did the majority of the CSS - after Bekah did the initial setup/styling.  I felt like that was a place where you could have done some more of the work when you were having trouble with other parts of the code.

I am happy to discuss any of this with you if you’d like and I am sorry for not sharing it earlier.

#### Noah Berman (Pahlka Co-Leader)
Noah, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to get more involved with Pahlka this mod.  You did a LOT of the heavy lifting - especially with the Spikes you led - and I appreciated that. Im going to do my best to carry on the tradition!

One piece of small constructive feedback that I would give you is that I do think there were times this mod where there was some room to involve me a bit more as a co-lead.  For instance, I offered to help/brainstorm/etc on the first spike around Civic Tech but didn’t hear anything - to be honest, it was a bit awkward to then find out that you and Ali had partnered and were presenting. I suspect this is mostly the result of time constraints/etc with your Mod4 work, but thought I’d mention it as something to consider/reflect on in the future.


## Being a Community Member

#### Noah Berman (Pahlka Co-Leader)
We kind of ambushed Sam with the offer to co-lead Pahlka Posse at the end of last mod, and he has taken on the position with skill and enthusiasm. His work in trying to obtain more resources for Pahlka as well as building our engagement with mods 1 + 2 has been and continues to be incredibly valuable in terms of Pahlka's continued existence. Thanks so much for your willingness to take the helm of the good ship Pahlka Posse, and #pahlkaforever!

#### Nick Chambers (Pahlka dude)
Sam stepped up to the plate to be one of our fearless leaders for the Pahlka Posse. He took on a bunch of responsbility for communicating to the posse at large and getting things organized. Most importantly, he is a cool and intelligent dude who has been fun to spend time with. He has a lot of knowledge and passion for education, and I think he's the right leader to carry the posse into the future.

## Playing a Part

<!-- I think I have played a very active part in the Turing Community this mod.  I have been one of the more active members in the Pahlka Posse and am excited to dig in further to the public ed data api project next Mod.  I also think I have been a valuable addition to Gear Ups and other community-oriented conversations on campus.  I look forward to doing more over the next two mods as we move into a more inviting/productive shared-community space.  I have also done my best to pair with Mod1 students as much as possible and think I've been very effective as a pairing partner with them. -->
