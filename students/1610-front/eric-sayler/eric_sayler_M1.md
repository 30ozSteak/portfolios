## A: End of Module Assessment

### Evaluator: Robbie

### Notes
* Everything was there conceptually, but was rusty from working on game time during the past two weeks
* Changing the CSS height was simpler than he thought, could use a brush up on CSS
* Atom work flow was not as clean as it should have been and slowed down progress (why not do the assessment using VIM?)
* Communication was good, could use a little more "why" and not just "what"

### Scores

#### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

##### Scores Rubric

###### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

###### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

###### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

###### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

##### evaluation comments

* JavaScript needed refactoring, a bunch of long functions that needed to be broken down
* JavaScript was pretty DRY overall, but needed refactoring
* The event bubbling selections were too vague (using document instead of a specific container)
* Workflow was good technically, but there needed to be more conversation in pull requests
* Left in some dummy links in the HTML...shouldn't be there
* CSS was not DRY and could use some refactoring, but the styles matched the comp well

##### Scores Rubric

###### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

###### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
- **2.5**
- 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

###### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

###### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

###### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### Feedback from Jeff

* Excellent planning and organization
* Great mindset for working with code
* Skilled at explaining things
* Use of methods/software I was unfamiliar with was frustrating at times
* Slightly sub-par communication

Going into the project, I was a bit worried about working w/ Eric. He's that guy that uses VIM, and actually understands at least half of what is going on in class. I was pleasantly surprised with the results though :slightly_smiling_face:

Eric is obviously very talented already, and regardless of his previous experience clearly has the right mindset for this type of work. He was rarely ever frustrated despite plenty of setbacks, and stayed confident that he could work his way through a problem. He was an excellent teacher whenever I didn't understand whatever witchcraft he was using that we'd never gone over in class, and was always happy to explain things. His desire to plan our attack before starting was greatly appreciated, and we stayed very well-organized throughout the project. His workflow is also amazingly efficient, and I'm not just enamored by VIM. Ok, fine, actually I think VIM is pretty awesome.

At the time I thought it would've been nice if he hadn't used VIM, RegEx, or other similar sorcery. Looking back on it, I'm actually glad to have gotten an introduction to all of it though. Communication could use a bit of improvement, but wasn't an issue often. On larger, more complicated projects it potentially could've been though.

Overall it was a pleasure working with Eric, and I look forward to picking his brain about VIM setup once I have the time to get into it. I'm a sucker for elaborate keybindings :slightly_smiling_face:

##### Feedback from Sam

- Thought we did really well as a pair by dividing up work and attacking the project in a way where we could both learn and take the most out of the experience.
- Appreciated you taking the initiative to set up the Waffle.io - I wouldn’t have created it if not.
- I know you were frustrated with my use of Git and appreciate your patience there.  You had more experience using Git and I appreciated your help there.
- Overall, I really enjoyed working with you on our first project.  I thought we did a pretty good job considering it was our first project!
- One piece of constructive feedback - with respect to the coding aspect of the project, I felt like you did jump into my JS code towards the end of the project and didn’t really engage with me on it and the changes you were making. As a result, I had to go back and change a bunch of things back to what I had created and redo the work to ensure I could move forward since I didn’t really understand the changes you had made.  I know you are more experienced with JS and coding languages in general, but I’d just encourage you to make sure future partners are able to follow along when pairing with you as you work through shared code. I know it isn’t easy to go slow and have to explain stuff - I will likely be there with partners as well in the future - but something to consider towards being a good partner/team member.


#### Idea Box

* [Idea Box GitHub URL](https://github.com/esayler/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### Notes

* Should be using IDs in HTML for unique elements and sharing classes for CSS styling, HTML was otherwise clean
* CSS needed some refactoring since there was some repetition
* JavaScript was good, but could use some refactoring into smaller functions
* The searching and tag filtering had some unexpected user interaction where tags were selected, but if a search term was added then all of the results would appear regardless of what tags were selected
* Using localStorage to search through ideas and hide them; this can be done through the DOM so as not to go through localStorage and risk changing user's data
* Could use more conversation in PRs, but git/GitHub workflow looked good otherwise

##### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

###### HTML Style

- 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

###### CSS Style

- 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

###### JavaScript Style

- 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Workflow

- 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

###### Collaboration

- 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

##### Feedback from Elijah

It was great working with you.  I really felt like you knew your stuff, and you were confident at every step.  The area I would challenge you in is code organization and teaching.  I think both of these can go hand-in-hand.  You bring a wealth of knowledge to the table and unique ways of attacking problems, so focus on organizing your code in a way that can be easily verbalized to others.  I really enjoyed learning from you.   Looking forward to working with you next mod!
