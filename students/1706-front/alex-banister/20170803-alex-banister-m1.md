Proficient

##### CSS

// Start getting into the habit of alphabetizing the properties

Proficient

##### JS/jQuery

// Inconsistency with event listener naming conventions // Nested if/else statements // Opportunities to simplify what a function is doing/pull pieces of functionality out into their own functions // Interesting choice to use an object to format the HTML/Link divs but would prefer functionality to be in small functions
