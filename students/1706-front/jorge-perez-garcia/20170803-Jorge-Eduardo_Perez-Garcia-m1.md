# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

Firstly, I wanted to wholly dedicate myself to this program and learn as much as I possible could. I had no idea what to expect, but I quickly learned software engineering requires dedication and strict time management skills. Secondly, and most importantly, I sought to find avenues that would allow me to incorporate my knowledge of fine arts and communication design into these modules.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
This challenging first project required us to generate a number guesser. This was the first time I became aware of the possibilities the Turing program has to offer. This project also allowed me to learn that I would eventually be able to perform tasks similar to those I currently do in on Adobe Illustrator's artboard.

#### Static Comp #1
* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
This was the first time I saw the power in CSS. I was able to incorporate my own artistic abilities by inserting my personalized artwork (e.g. icons). I am confident this work will be part of my permanent portfolio.

#### Static Comp #2
* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
Once again,I was able to incorporate my own artistic abilities by inserting my personalized artwork (e.g. pok√©mon characters). I also enjoyed learning about and applying FlexBox. This static comp allowed me to employ the rules and principles of visual design.

#### Static Comp #3
* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
This static comp included more visual content than past static comps (e.g. more buttons). Because this project was in the midst of the courses's module exams, I mostly learned about time management and efficiency.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
Linked List allowed end-users to keep a collection of saved links. Links were designed to be marked as 'read' or 'unread', and end-users were provided the option to delete links.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
Idea Box was designed for end-users to keep a note of ideas. Then, a three-tier rating system was implemented to allow the end-user to rate their ideas.

#### To Do

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)
The To Do project tasked designers to refactor a classmate's Idea Box project into a new application that allowed end-users to append items into a to-do or task list. Part of the refactoring required altering the user interface to enhance the experience for the end-users.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)


Receiving and giving feedback: I learned about different types of feedback. It goes hand in hand with who gives feedback so you have to be attentive with how you're predisposed to seeing it. Learning about feedback helped me think about not only collegial relationships, but also feedback with familial and personal relationships. I reinforced what I learned on how to give feedback during critiques in art school. 


Professional development: Professional development is a big key to success; in today's world, emotional IQ is just as important as technical expertise. I learned about social media profiles and creating an online persona. I alsolearned I should update and maintain ocial media profiles that I've historically neglected (e.g. LinkedIn). 




## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

For networking purposes, I believe it is important to make friends rather than contacts, and I made it a goal to befriend my project partners. I also made it a point to empathize with my fellow classmates.  Through my own struggles, I held a positive attitude while working or talking with others to build a sense of community. On a personal level, I led two yoga classes for my fellow module-mates that (hopefully) allowed others to temporarily escape their stresses and focus on rejuvenating their mental health.
