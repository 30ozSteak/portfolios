### Specification Adherence

- 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

- 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

## Swapi Box

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### CSS/Design

3.5 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

3.5 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbiegreiner/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

## Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## Code Quality

3 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

## PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing.

## Surprise and Delight

# C: Professional Skills

## Gear Up
### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

A reflection on micro-agressions, this Gear-Up provided a good opportunity to reflect on the everyday interactions I find myself in and how I can better be aware of others' identities. This is an important topic for us all to consider as our world becomes "smaller" given how connected we all are thanks to technology.

### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

The Parable of the Paragon was a thought-provoking medium through which to view and discuss diversity. The way in which the statistics on something as small as neighbor preference were displayed and interactive for the user not only caused me to reflect on some of my own choices, but also have ideas about what I can build with the skills I'm gaining at Turing.

However, I think this Gear-Up's title needs to be changed, because the "Tragedy of the Commons" is a specific economic problem, and not what this Gear-Up was about.


### Mod 4 Lead - Toxic Masculinity in Nerd Culture

This Gear-Up attempted to have us dive into a rather vast issue, being masculinity prevalant across all types of nerd culture. I engage in interesting dialogue with my classmates, but I think we all found that the issue was much bigger than we initially thought as we talked it out.

# D: Community Participation

## Playing a Part

I maintain a google doc of mod-specific resources for my classmates to use as we go throughout the mod.
Paired with lower mod students on a few occasions.
Helped re-start my posse.
