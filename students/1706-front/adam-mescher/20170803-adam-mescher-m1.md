## E: Community Participation

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

The gear up on growth mindset set the tone for my mental state during mod 1. Knowing that many difficult challanges were ahead, the ability to shift into a state of mind that accepts the challange willingly had a strong positive impact.

#### Working Styles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

It was fascinating to realize that introversion and extroversion are not binary but rather on a spectrum and how they effect teams. Hearing the personal experiences from those on the opposite side of the spectrum was an illuminating look into how others view the world. Using the knowledge from this session not only helped with my group projects at Turing but also with my roomates.

#### Strengths and Storytelling

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

This session forced a hard look into who I am as a person and what drives me professionally. Talking about it with a partner during the session definately helped me gain a stronger grasp on how to tell my story well. The ability to tell that story doesn't happen overnight, must practice intentionally. 

#### Coding Schools or Coding Fools

* [Imgur URL of whiteboard with talking points](http://imgur.com/a/rjaPf)

This session was an introspection into coding schools, Turing in particular, and whether we're all idiots or does this model actually have some merits. I found it interesting that we all held a similar perspective, probably because we've all already justified the expense of Turing. The question still looms on my mind but I'm confident that the knowledge gained while at Turing is invaluable and is something employers will desire for years to come.
