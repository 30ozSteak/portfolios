## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

While I worked hard to create a solid foundation of Javascipt fundamentals, I utilized my spare time to work through CSS practices to make sure my skills on both ends of the front end engineering curriculum were at their best. I spend time doing individual research on subjects I didn't understand or wanted to learn more about, while helped me gain a greater understanding for web design and computer science as a whole.  

#### Mythical Creatures

The goal of this assignment was to exemplify mastery over CSS and HTML styling by creating a page with lots of unique buttons and elements, and to make this page responsive on small screens. While the layout is true to the original comp, I took liberties with the content and slight layout changes to make room for a hero image.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In my group projects I had a chance to work on code with my classmates, which led to lots of experiential learning. While I enjoyed working with my classmates and learning from my project partners, I found it difficult to not be in control of the whole project, and had to learn to trust my partners' abilities in completing their part of the project. 

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/nicktu12/numberGuesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

The goal of this project was to begin working with Javascipt functionality while manipulating the DOM to create a simple game out of guessing numbers.
