# Ben Module 4 (Front-end)
 ### Areas of Emphasis
 
 As I entered mod-4 I was very excited about learning the backend to fully round out my turing experience. My main goal was to extend my experties in a way that I would feel confident applying to full stack development positions though clearly with a focus on the fron-end. My other goal was to continue to build confidence in preperation for finding a job.
