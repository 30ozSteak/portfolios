# Travis Rollins - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to get a better grasp of Javascript and work on writing cleaner code.  By the end of the module, I felt like I had a really good understanding of Javascript and knowing how to refactor my code.  I also wanted to get better at Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven-Development.  I feel much more confident in both of these fields after completing the Game Time project using HTML canvas and building the Weatherly project using React. This module was also a great chance to keep building on my skills with teamwork and adapting to different work styles.
