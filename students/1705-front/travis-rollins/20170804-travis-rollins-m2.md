# Travis Rollins - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to get a better grasp of Javascript and work on writing cleaner code.  By the end of the module, I felt like I had a really good understanding of Javascript and knowing how to refactor my code.  I also wanted to get better at Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven-Development.  I feel much more confident in both of these fields after completing the Game Time project using HTML canvas and building the Weatherly project using React. This module was also a great chance to keep building on my skills with teamwork and adapting to different work styles.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I completed two individual projects this module including:
  * Sorting Suite
  * Complete-Me
  
The Sorting Suite project was a great chance for me to practice my Javascript skills by creating different sorting algorithms.  Complete-Me was another great chance for me to practice Javascript, ES6, and Object-Oriented-Programming by creating a Trie data structure using count, suggest, insert, populate, and select methods to auto-complete words from a dictionary.

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Sorting-Suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

The Sorting Suite project includes different sorting algorithms including:
  * Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort

## Instructor: Nathaniel
## Optional Notes:

PASS

Student was able to successfuly explain how each of the algorithms worked and what was going behind the scenes when using recursion.

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete-Me is Trie data structure implementation using count, suggest, insert, populate, and select methods to auto-complete words from a dictionary and append them to the DOM.

## Instructor: Limbo
## Optional Notes:

* More testing! Test the simplest things, edge cases, etc.
  * Break out tests into step-by-step assertions
* Be consistent (i.e. for loops and forEach...)

# Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

## Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

## Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

## Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

## Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

## Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
