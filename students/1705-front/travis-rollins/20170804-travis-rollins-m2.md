# Travis Rollins - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to get a better grasp of Javascript and work on writing cleaner code.  By the end of the module, I felt like I had a really good understanding of Javascript and knowing how to refactor my code.  I also wanted to get better at Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven-Development.  I feel much more confident in both of these fields after completing the Game Time project using HTML canvas and building the Weatherly project using React. This module was also a great chance to keep building on my skills with teamwork and adapting to different work styles.

## Rubric Scores

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I completed two individual projects this module including:
  * Sorting Suite
  * Complete-Me
  
The Sorting Suite project was a great chance for me to practice my Javascript skills by creating different sorting algorithms.  Complete-Me was another great chance for me to practice Javascript, ES6, and Object-Oriented-Programming by creating a Trie data structure using count, suggest, insert, populate, and select methods to auto-complete words from a dictionary.

# Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Sorting-Suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

The Sorting Suite project includes different sorting algorithms including:
	* Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort

## Instructor: Nathaniel
## Optional Notes:

PASS

Student was able to successfuly explain how each of the algorithms worked and what was going behind the scenes when using recursion.

# Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete-Me is Trie data structure implementation using count, suggest, insert, populate, and select methods to auto-complete words from a dictionary and append them to the DOM.

## Instructor: Limbo
## Optional Notes:

* More testing! Test the simplest things, edge cases, etc.
  * Break out tests into step-by-step assertions
* Be consistent (i.e. for loops and forEach...)

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I completed 2 group projects this module including:
	* Game Time
  * Weathrly
	
Our team used Javascript and HTML canvas to re-create the game Tron for Game Time. This was also the first time that we had started implementing tests using mocha and chai to check and make sure the game was working correctly. For Weathrly, our team used React, ES6, and api calls to make a weather application. We spent much more time this project doing Test-Driven-Development using Jest and Enzyme.

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Game-Time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This is a re-creation of the game Tron using Javascript and HTML canvas.

## Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
## Instructor: Meeka
## Optional Notes:

## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

Make sure button to reset matches style

Need some stylistic indication of the win and loss to drag the eye to it

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from eslint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Feedback

Travis was extremely hard-working and motivated during this project.  Whenever we were stuck on something in our project, Travis would commit to figuring out how to solve the problem.  He always took the time to explain how his code worked and was always open to new ideas. His patience and drive helped keep the team inspired throughout the project.
