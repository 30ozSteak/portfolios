# (Travis Rollins) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to really get a good grasp of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  While I understood a bit of HTML and CSS, I had absolutely no understanding of Javascript before this.  It was my goal to understand the logic of how the languages worked, and I felt like I really accomplished that goal.  I also was really interested in working with partners and getting some experience of what it is like to work in this profession.  It was a good experience doing projects together and working off of other people's code.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following is the first project that I did by myself.  I developed a number guessing game using basic HTML and CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

#### (Number Guesser)

* [Number Guesser Project](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Number-Guesser-Project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project is a number guessing game. The game was developed in order to practice Javascript and combine it with HTML and CSS. DOM manipulation was also used to develop this project. This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Evaluator: Brenna

Did a great job with completing the three phases.  Could refactor code more and have less lines in my functions.
