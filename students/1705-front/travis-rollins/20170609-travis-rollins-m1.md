# (Travis Rollins) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to really get a good grasp of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  While I understood a bit of HTML and CSS, I had absolutely no understanding of Javascript before this.  It was my goal to understand the logic of how the languages worked, and I felt like I really accomplished that goal.  I also was really interested in working with partners and getting some experience of what it is like to work in this profession.  It was a good experience doing projects together and working off of other people's code.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following is the first project that I did by myself.  I developed a number guessing game using basic HTML and CSS, and vanilla Javascript.  This was my first attempt at Javascript and was a great learning experience understanding how functions work and how to manipulate the DOM.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/Number-Guesser-Project)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project is a number guessing game. The game was developed in order to practice Javascript and combine it with HTML and CSS. DOM manipulation was also used to develop this project. This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Proficient__ : Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

#### Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.

#### Functions & Scope

* __Proficient:__ Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### DOM Manipulation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.
* __Proficient:__ Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Novice:__ Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.

### Projects

Travis, overall, was an excellent partner to be paired with. We got along very well, and really without a huge amount of effort, were able to complete the project with a level of quality we both were very pleased with. He was very easy to make plans with, and was motivated to work. Would definitely like to be paired again in the future. If I had to come up with some coaching feedback for Travis (which I do), it would be to do everything he could to get down all the various keyboard shortcuts for OSX. But really, I was beyond satisfied with the experience.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danalvarez5280/Idea-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project is an idea-list application that keeps track of important ideas one is interested in. The application was developed in order to practice using localStorage as well as continue practice using jQuery for logic and DOM manipulation. This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Evaluator: Brenna

Significant refactoring necessary.

## Evaluation Scores: Pending (All main functionality done)

Dear Travis, I thought we worked extremely well together. From the moment we sat down and did our DTR, I thought we were on the same page about everything. We both had a lot of input on the jquery. You made the process go by a lot faster by making the foundations of the jquery simple and understandable. I know that it was annoying that I stuck with the counter technique even though it was hard to understand and eventually caused us a bit more work in the end. I appreciate your patience as well as your flexibility with me in the project. Schedule wise we were on the same page, and you were extremely accommodating with working around the Static Comp project. I hope we get a chance to work together in the future as I felt our skillsets complimented each other. I thought that we both stayed positive even when we both were extremely frustrated at times. I cannot find one bad thing about this project. Other than the fact that I made the counter into a confusing mess on the page. Thanks again for making the process smooth and easy. I wish you the best in the next project. -Dan Alvarez

#### 2DoBoxPivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Shayla303/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project is an TODO-list application that keeps track of important tasks one needs to complete. The application was developed in order to practice going through another team's code, refactoring it, and adding more functionality to it. This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Evaluator: Brenna
Overall good job with functionality.  Still some inconsistency/lack of semantic refactoring to "Todos" vs "Ideas".  All there is some additional refactoring that could be done in the style of the Javascript.

Travis was a great partner who possessed a great deal of patience as I was sick at the beginning of the project. Travis was definitely focused on making it through all phases of the project, whereas I was content to have a firm stopping point. I really admire the go far at all costs attitude, it was inspiring. Our approach was a side by side navigator driver approach which I felt was collaborative and helpful. We talked through our code, solutions, and why or how something wouldn't work. Travis was really open to trying new things with the code. During our project I also lost my lightning talk and had to redo it. Travis again, was super accommodating and empathetic and gave leniency so I could work on that. I felt very bad as I didn't feel I was giving equity to the time and input on this project the way he was. Travis definitely has strong ideas and when his mind is set it's set. That is a wonderful quality, I do think in a project if you both make a committed goal, then it should be honored. After we'd separated Travis sent me a message later saying he worked through the rest of the functionality and would show me later, again I felt like "what did I do to move this along?" Travis was very apologetic to me as his intentions were not to "leave me behind", I do know for certain his intentions were not malicious, but he wanted to learn through every phase. I get it and am glad he was my partner. Perhaps my own insecurities are making me feel less than equal. I would partner with Travis again anytime as our personalities work well together and I consider him one of my good friends in our cohort.
