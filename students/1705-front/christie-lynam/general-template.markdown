* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Evaluator: Louisa

Optional Notes:

SUCH A GOOD JOB!!!!! Really solid, very well done and nicely refactored. The tidiest, cleaned codebase I saw in this assessment. Very well done.

Functional Expectations

Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
HTML

Accessibility

Exceptional Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.
Style

Exceptional Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations.
CSS

Structure of Code

Exceptional Understands the performance implications surrounding cascading/specificity and crafts CSS that is mindful of reducing complexity and increasing performance.
Implementation

Proficient: Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
JAVASCRIPT

Conditional Logic

Proficient: Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.
Functions & Scope

Proficient: Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.
DOM Manipulation

Proficient: Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.
Style

Exceptional Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication.
DESIGN

Comp Recreation

Proficient: Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

Optional Notes:

through phase 4

Great work building out the UI! Really nicely done, extremely solid execution, very nice responsive solution.

Paired very effectively together. Used github really well, leveraged all the tools (commits, issues, etc). Great team work! As usual, any HTML and CSS that Christie works on is extremely well executed and implemented.

Very clean code, well structured, they both owned the entire code base, very even distribution of work/effort.

Functional Expectations

Exceptional You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
HTML

Accessibility

|Exceptional | Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc. |

Style

|Exceptional | Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations. |

CSS

Structure of Code

|Exceptional | Understands the performance implications surrounding cascading/specificity and crafts CSS that is mindful of reducing complexity and increasing performance.|

Implementation

|Exceptional | Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.|

JAVASCRIPT

Conditional Logic

|Proficient | Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

GIT & GITHUB

Git

|Exceptional | Knows how to reset to previous commits, rebase large sets of small commits, if applicable, and other advanced Git maneuvers. |

Github

|Exceptional | Uses issues as resource for project management. There are comments on specific lines of pull requests with discussion about the implementation.|

DESIGN

Comp Recreation

|Exceptional | Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.|

PAIRING

Collaboration

|Exceptional | Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.|

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I definitely stepped up and took on more of a leadership role within my cohort this mod. I served as a SAB rep and always made myself available to anyone that needed help. Just being familiar with the structure of things and knowing what to anticipate, increased my confidence level tremendously. It was a great feeling being able to give back this time around.
