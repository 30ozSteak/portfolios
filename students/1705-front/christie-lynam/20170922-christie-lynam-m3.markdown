## A: End of Module Assessment

PASSED!!!
Scored all 3s

## B. Individual Work & Projects

I did my self-directed project with Margo Schaedel... see below (Do You)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Headcount

* [Headcount Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

##### Students: Christie Lynam and Margo Schaedel

##### Instructor: Brittany

###### Specification Adherence

* 4 - The application completes all 5 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

###### Code Quality

* 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

###### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

###### CSS/Design

* 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

###### Testing

* 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested.

###### Surprise and Delight

* 4 - Unicorn

#### SWapi-Box

* [SWapi-Box Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

##### Students: Christie Lynam and Travis Rollins

##### Instructor: Jhun

###### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

###### Code Quality

* 3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### Design

* 3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

##### Testing

* 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### MovieTracker

* [MovieTracker Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

##### Students: Christie Lynam, Nick Svetnicka and Nik Bornemeier

##### Instructor: Jhun

###### Specification Adherence

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

###### Redux Architecture

* 3.5: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

###### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

###### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

###### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

#### Do You

* [Do You Frontend Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/do-you)
* [Do You Backend Repo](https://github.com/christielynam/do-you-postgres)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

##### Students: Christie Lynam and Margo Schaedel

##### Instructor: Jhun

###### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
Have enough technical challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a content challenge)

###### Feature Delivery

1. Completion

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

2. Organization

* 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

###### Technical Quality

1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).

2. Code Quality

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

###### Product Experience

1. User Experience

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

2. Performance

* 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Gear Up 1: Microaggressions

<!-- I think Turing does a great job of providing an environment where people feel safe & welcome no matter their background or prior experiences. As an individual, I can work on being a little more extroverted and getting to know my cohort and community better. I love being alone and working alone, but I also recognize that this can sometimes alienate me from the rest of the group. Because of this, others are probable less willing to open up and share their experiences with me. And this is crucial in the process of becoming more empathetic. -->

#### Gear Up 2: Groupthink

<!-- When reflecting on what it takes to be an ally at Turing, a few things come to mind. Probably most important, ask questions! Try understanding why others feel the way they do. Don't attack others when trying when attempting to be an ally for a particular group or person. Offer another thought process without attacking. And LISTEN! -->

#### Gear Up 3: The not so subtle art of not giving a fuck

<!-- There are numerous ways that one can contribute and give back to the community even being a tech newbie. While still at Turing, you can mentor lower mod students, lead a spike, and even start contributing to open source projects. You know more than you think you know and you are absolutely qualified to give back! -->


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

<!-- This was my second mod to serve as my cohort's SAB representative. I also took a leadership role in organizing and encouraging pairings between Mod 1 and Mod 2. I am including feedback from 3 individuals that I paired with on multiple occasions this mod. -->
