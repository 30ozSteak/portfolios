### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Victoria Vasys): It was really nice working with you! I think we balanced each other out in many helpful ways, but I especially appreciated your ability to know when to step away, take breaks, refresh & re-gather. It really helped to have you brainstorm & sketch out the way you saw different aspects of the project going & helped us keep the important stuff at the forefront. Your positive attitude really helped me step out of some serious and/or frustrating moments & it felt really good to have celebrations for every little accomplishment we made! I think you would benefit from diving into Ruby docs and getting some more understanding of various methods, especially for Enumberables (although we only *just* started learning those, so don't feel like you're behind or anything!) I would highly recommend doing exercises whenever (or if ever...) you have free time. I think we could both use more practice in Object Oriented Programming, especially with single-responsibility (less daisy-chaining)-- so if you find good resources on practice with that, I'd really appreciate links! Thanks for being such a great collaborator, encouraging me be more outgoing in asking questions & keeping us on task; I think we both learned a lot & it was a great first paired programming experience! Well done, sir! :)

My feedback to Victoria Vasys: You were a great asset to the team. You are very professional and focused on your work. Despite the difficult deadlines for the Night Writer Project, you maintained a positive attitude. You responded to problems without getting frustrated. You often stayed late working and were very conscientious of timelines and resources. When fixing a problem, you readily explained how you were fixing it. One thing to possibly improve in your skills is dividing responsibilities of the project parts with your team, allowing your partner to be more involved in coding of the project. It has been wonderful working with you and I hope I get the chance to work with you again in the future.
