# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?
>* Learn Javascript!
>* Do my final project using React

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
>*Getting comfortable using node.js in the backend was a challenge to get the project off the ground. It was definetely more manual than setting up a backend Rails API. Creating the relationship between meals and foods was also very difficult without the assistance of Rails Helpers.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
>*First I reviewed our lessons from class to understand the concepts/functions of Node, Express and Knex. Then I planned out what I wanted to do and would go to the docs to figure out what the syntax was. The functionality ended up being similar it was just more of a manual process than a Rails app.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
>*I liked discovering new ways to complete the same task in another language. It helps me draw connections to what i'm doing and furthers my knowledge. For example, yesterday I was working on rails and when I ran rake:db create I noticed I created a dev and test database on my computer. I never noticed I was creating two databases until I had to manually do it on this project.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
>*Building a backend RESTful API with Node, Express and Knex. Using vanilla JS and JQuery to manipulate the DOM. Use Ajax calls to communicate with the database without reloading the page.
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
>*Trying to understand the overall technical concepts before diving into the code.
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
>*It was a difficult experience. I thought my pair and I worked best when we were working on our own but it was difficult to do that with this project. I had a little background knowledge in manipulating the DOM with JS so I tried to share that knowledge with my partner as often as I could.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
