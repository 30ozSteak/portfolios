## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Stephanie Bentley): Overall I felt like this was a really successful first paired project. I felt like we were on the same page for pretty much everything. I thought communication was good and time was well managed.  I also think we did a good of evenly balancing the workload and sharing responsibilities.
Specifically, you were patient with me when it came to GitHub. I totally messed up my branches, and you didn’t get upset or frustrated. You just sat down and helped sort things out.  You were also really good about making sure you understood what was confusing you about the project. For example, with the File IO stuff, right away you said “I want to make sure I really understand this, because it tripped me up in the last project.”  Also, when we came back with different pieces of the project working, you were intent on making sure you understood the pieces I brought back. I also think your willingness to persevere and tackle difficult problems (both together and independently) allowed us to make progress each day.
What could be better? I think we both let ourselves “give in” a little bit a the end of the last night. We may have leaned on Jasmin too heavily the last night, and we could have been more motivating for each other to clean things up (refactor longer methods, get capitals working) at the end.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
I enjoyed this Gear Up a lot because it closely relates to my undergraduate focus: Neuroscience Psychology. It was very interesting to see how the neurons in the brain act differently in a fixed mindset brain vs. growth mindset brain when faced with a challenge.
For myself, past experiences have encouraged both fixed/growth mindsets.
The first fixed mindset experience that comes to mind is being 'let go' from my previous job. That decision told my mind that 'sales' isn't for me and i'm not good at it.
A past experience that led to a growth mindset was playing on the same basketball team as kids from Brooklyn. It opened my eyes that there were kids that were much more talented than me and I wanted to play with them to improve my skill level.
I move into a fixed mindset when I get overwhelmed and don't see an easy solution. I need to focus on staying calm, understand the problem, break it down into separate elements, and then begin working on a piece.


#### Getting Better At Hard Things
Overall, this Gear Up session was very interesting. The concept that all cognitive energy is stored in one tank stuck with me after the session. From now on while taking a break from coding, I will step away from the computer to give my eyes a rest.
While managing my learning process, I try not to get to high/low with my emotions. By keeping my emotions stable, it helps me focus on what's next without thinking about my previous successes/failures. Even though I ideally don't want to look backwards, I find myself still doing it from time to time.
With coding, there is always more to learn, there are no unicorns. Everyone has to start at the beginning but the ceiling is infinite so you're always going to be faced with new challenges.
It's much easier to take in new information when your emotional state is in a healthy place. When your cognitive energy is being strained by other stresses, its' harder to learn.
