### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Knight Writer: Josh Thompson: "Seth. It was great fun to work with you on Night Writer. You were extremely helpful and patient working through TDD and refactoring with me, despite my late-in-the-game restart. Your easy-going disposition served us both well, and your comfort with Ruby methods was obvious. With a tiny adjustment to hashes instead of case statements, I think you’re on top of everything that’s been passed our way so far."

### Job Prep

*   Resume with a summary statement and placeholder for projects and skills to be obtained during Turing: [link](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/ixw63ikpmhw)

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
Don't hold yourself back by focusing on the grades or how bad you do. Keep an open mind and continue to learn. Mistakes are a good thing and failure is how we learn.

#### Session 2
Don't bunch everything up in catagory **B** move one at a time from **A** to **B** to **C**. Master one thing at a time, get a handle on it before moving onto something new.

#### Session 3
Find ways to deal with stress, something you're comfortable with that's not self destructive. Watch a movie, take a walk, meet with friends. Don't immediately turn to alcohol/other unhealthy options.

#### Session 4
Even now there's still a lot of discrimination in the workplace. I may not see it because I don't personally have to deal with it, but keep an eye out, learn the signals and querks people do that show discrimination and take a stand against it. Don't let it to continue because doing nothing is the same and being the one discriminating.

### Community Participation
I've been very active on slack offering help to others, helping others with code problems and sending out drills that are relavent to our current projects/assignments. There when people need help.
