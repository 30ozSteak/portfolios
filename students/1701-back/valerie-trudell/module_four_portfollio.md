###Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

    - Showing up to class on time
    - Communicating with instructors
    - Completing assignments on time  
    - Go to meet-ups

### Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

    1. What was your biggest technical challenge?
          - getting the first api request done -> adding a link
    2. What did you like the most about the challenge?
          - using my new knowledge of javascript on the assessment
    3. How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
          - I added a link via jQuery ...........................
    4. What did you learn?
          - I learned more about Selenium testing and how to tests the model tests

### Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

    What was your biggest technical challenge?
      - Getting contentEditable to work and persisting it to the database

    How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
      - Well first we tried what was obvious, when it didn't work we looked it up,
      when the internet's answers weren't working we tried something very simple and the
      contentEditable worked, and for the update we wound up asking a peer for how they approach it
      and we wound up having to restructed some backend code and then it worked.

    What did you like the most about the challenge?
      - The satisfaction of it being completed

    What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
      - Testing in javascript
      - How routing in javascript can be organized and why it is organized the way it is in other languages  
      - Patience :)

    If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
      - I wish we broke more things out into different files so that is was dry and well organized
    What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
      - Hard, we rabbit holed a ton, but it was nice to have someone to struggle with.

### Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

    Reflection:
      - I was really disappointed with this project, because when it started I
      choose something that I was very much interested and would have been a good
      challenge for me, but I had computer problems, and things were far behind schedule, so we decided to do a different project, a password manager,
      and while that was far easier to do, I wasn't nearly as attached to it, and
      I had so much going on that I didn't get a chance to make it my own. The most
      disappointing part was that it was Monday night and my website was in absolute
      terrible shape, I had essentially run out of time, and it wasn't even in an
      MVP status, and I had already pulled an all nighter to get it to where it was.
      But, I couldn't let myself turn in that project in the current shape it was in
      so I buckled down Monday night, and as the sun rose on Tuesday, I had a still buggy and partly implemented application, but it was something. I used bootstrap
      which I had never willing done on my own, and it looked like an actual site.
      When evaluation came I was shocked by the scores I had gotten, but proud that
      I had made a thing, a small thing, but still in that time frame. This project
      reassured me that I had not in fact lost touch with Rails which is something I worried about.
      
    What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
      - spring
      - code climate

### Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

    Valerie, thanks for the many times you reviewed my code and answered my questions. I was lucky to have a partner that knew JavaScript as well as you do! I learned a lot from this project, and especially from the way you organized our app into MVC and classes.
    Occasionally (well, frequently) we’d run into bugs and asynchronous errors, and it was definitely frustrating. Here’s one piece of advice that has helped me: “Every output has a reason, and every bug has a solution. ”
    Now, it’s not always possible to find the reason, or worthwhile to fix it, but just remembering that helps me check my assumptions and step through the code line by line.
    Thanks again for all the effort and skills you brought to our team!

### Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
    The gear up session I was apart of did giving back to the community. I had a
    fun time doing it I felt that the people I planned it with were happy to be
    there and excited about tell people about getting involved.


### Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

  Beside running a gear up, I attended meet-ups around Denver, mostly security focuses, started a blog, and found some online communities
  that I will be involved in and start to answer questions such as stack overflow, and ruby irc forums. I think the community part of Turing is important to have to that we leave Turing with a connection to the community while we wont always have instructors right there to answer our questions; people from the community can answer questions and provide some support as well.

### Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

  1. Learning security specifically pen-testing
  2. Learning python
  3. Learn how to make email server
