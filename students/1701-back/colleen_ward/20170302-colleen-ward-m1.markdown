## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](http://example.com) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Night Writer (Yohanan Assefa): It was great working with you on night writer, Colleen. You were committed to getting the project done and brought a strong understanding of Ruby. It was helpful to observe you test out different approaches/methods, consistently use pry, and not get easily frustrated when we hit roadblocks. I appreciate your willingness to go slow and explain various concepts/methods to me when I had a hard time figuring out different aspects of the project. I’m very glad I got to pair with you and I’ve learned a lot from this experience. I have no doubt that your strong grasp of programming and ability to feel/show empathy and kindness towards others will make you an outstanding developer.
*   Project 2 (First Last): lorem ipsum

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
I really enjoyed the Gear Up session on growth mindset. I had never heard of growth/fixed mindset and it immediately made an impact on me. Having a growth mindset is essential to attending Turing and learning new things in general. If you have a fixed mindset, then you don’t think you can learn new things. Learning about growth mindset and thinking about past experiences and what held me back from having a growth mindset, really made me think about ways I can avoid that while attending Turing, including focusing on small successes I have made, talking to others that may also be “stuck” on a project or asking questions when I don’t understand something.

#### Session 2
The Gear Up session on getting better at difficult things introduced me to another new concept - cognitive load. I found it very fascinating about how increased cognitive load can impact your ability to handle stress and learning new things. I also really liked the idea that Kathy Sierra presented about the three things that take up cognitive resources- the things we can’t do but need to learn, things we can do, but with effort, and then the things we have “mastered” and don’t need to think about much. Her ideas on how to reduce cognitive resources and move things from a to c, really helped me think of the things we have been learning in new ways and how I can approach new learnings.

#### Session 3
The Gear Up session on managing stress could not have come at a better time for me. I was starting to really feel stressed with just finishing up our first pair project, the mid mod diagnostic coming up and the HTTP project just assigned that I really had no idea where to start on. It gave me the space to really think about ways that help me de-stress and remind myself to try and do those things when I start to feel overwhelmed. They asked us to write down an action plan of sorts so that when we identify that we are stressed, we can do some of those things to “off ramp” before we get to a level 10 stress. I even did some of them the following weekend and that helped a lot!
