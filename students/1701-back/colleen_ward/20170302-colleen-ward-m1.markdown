## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](http://example.com) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Night Writer (Yohanan Assefa): It was great working with you on night writer, Colleen. You were committed to getting the project done and brought a strong understanding of Ruby. It was helpful to observe you test out different approaches/methods, consistently use pry, and not get easily frustrated when we hit roadblocks. I appreciate your willingness to go slow and explain various concepts/methods to me when I had a hard time figuring out different aspects of the project. I’m very glad I got to pair with you and I’ve learned a lot from this experience. I have no doubt that your strong grasp of programming and ability to feel/show empathy and kindness towards others will make you an outstanding developer.
*   Project 2 (First Last): lorem ipsum
