# Maria Stenquist - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?) To learn as much as I can! I wanted to fill in some gaps I had in core Ruby concepts (data types, data structures, abstraction, Ruby Object Model). At the beginning of this module, I set out to have a 'weekly plan' and also a 'daily plan' for goals/objectives that I wanted to complete for that day/week, and I would check them off at the end of the day/week. This system worked (for the most part) and it did help me to organize areas that I needed to focus on. I exercised my 'growth mindset', wrote lots of code (good and bad), and better utilized available resources (classmates, TA's, mentors, Google, debugging). Revisiting topics in a 'spiral of knowledge' method did help to solidify some key concepts. Being an active member of the Turing community: I have enjoyed working with the Hamilton posse as well as the Turing Diversity student group. I am looking forward to the 'diversity panel' that has been in the works, and the first one will be at the beginning of next module. Looking towards the future, I look forward to using these Ruby fundamentals and apply layers of other frameworks, and libraries and work on some interesting projects.

## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Craig Ness): Feedback for Maria (project: Night Writer)

### Maria was a great partner to work with. While I tended to get lost in the fine details of the code, she was able to keep track of the broader picture and scope and keep us moving in a positive direction. Whenever we got stuck for too long, she took initiative and sought out resources (mentors, upper-mod students) or took us through a white-boarding session that always got us back on track. Without this, our project would have stalled while we both stared at the same lines of code over and over again. Maria was also excellent at spotting potential roadblocks that our coding approach would create, had we continued with that approach. Many times I would find myself trying something only to have Maria point out why that way might not be the best way further down the road. She was able to save us both time and energy during these instances, and I found it unbelievably helpful. There were a few times when I wished that perhaps she took the driverâ€™s role a bit more, because often times it helps to step away from coding and watch someone else work for awhile, but our pairing strategy worked as we were able to implement all functionality from the specs into our project. Trying different pairing techniques might have helped us achieve this functionality at a faster pace, or with better TDD however. Finally, she was also great at coordinating Git and GitHub, and really helped me through that whole aspect of the project. Overall, I had a truly positive experience working with Maria, and I think our final product is definitely something to be proud of!
