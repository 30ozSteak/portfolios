### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Craig Ness): Feedback for Maria (project: Night Writer)

### Maria was a great partner to work with. While I tended to get lost in the fine details of the code, she was able to keep track of the broader picture and scope and keep us moving in a positive direction. Whenever we got stuck for too long, she took initiative and sought out resources (mentors, upper-mod students) or took us through a white-boarding session that always got us back on track. Without this, our project would have stalled while we both stared at the same lines of code over and over again. Maria was also excellent at spotting potential roadblocks that our coding approach would create, had we continued with that approach. Many times I would find myself trying something only to have Maria point out why that way might not be the best way further down the road. She was able to save us both time and energy during these instances, and I found it unbelievably helpful. There were a few times when I wished that perhaps she took the driver’s role a bit more, because often times it helps to step away from coding and watch someone else work for awhile, but our pairing strategy worked as we were able to implement all functionality from the specs into our project. Trying different pairing techniques might have helped us achieve this functionality at a faster pace, or with better TDD however. Finally, she was also great at coordinating Git and GitHub, and really helped me through that whole aspect of the project. Overall, I had a truly positive experience working with Maria, and I think our final product is definitely something to be proud of!

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
 Gear-up Session 1 (Growth Mindset) 1/27/17:

How do you think past experiences or experiences this week that have encouraged growth or fixed mindsets? Fixed mindsets: Thinking back to all the negativity I had in a previous learning environment. The atmosphere was so...toxic to providing a welcoming environment to learn. There were a few students there that made it their mission to put-down anybody they could, which was not a supportive environment, and certainly did not contribute to a growth-mindset. Pushing others down never props oneself up. This led to me feeling overwhelmed and wanting to get away.

Growth Mindset: The quote: "Your past does not dictate your future" came to mind. Things in my past that supported/promoted a growth mindset: learning to fly, living abroad, living out of suitcases, and learning a foreign language.
This quote: "Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle" has really helped me to maintain a growth mindset when I face a setback, or I think everyone else around me is naturally smarter.

What are your triggers, what's likely to move you to fixed mindset? My triggers include unfounded criticism, or general criticism given without warning/basis, yelling, passive-aggressive comments, leading to being disheartened, feeling dispair and shutting down. Unnecessary condescension will trigger me to glaze over in that situation. Feeling deflated leads me down a path towards fixed mindset. Also, lack of sleep/staring at code long past the point of diminishing returns is not productive towards a growth mindset.

What can you peers do to support you staying in the growth mindset? Finding support, talking through things, banishing negative self-talk/self-doubt, breaking down a problem into something managable. Talking with someone usually helps to bring the tension down. Peers can help me by being encouraging, working through speed-bumps together, and being there for each other while opening up about feeling overwhelmed can help tame the stress and keep me in a growth-mindset.

Small Group Discussion
        - silence the "I can't" voice
        - teaching: people do better in encouraging/supportive environments
        - When you fall behind and get stressed out: get help!
        - When the inside voices creep up: approach things from a different frame of mind. Also: get help!
        - keep moving forward, no matter how slow it seems. Just do not stop!
        - keep humble
        - utilize your resources (mentors, instructors, peers, Google)
        - figure out what you want to do, and then figure out HOW to do it. It's never too late.
        - get comfortable bombing things.
        - have zero pride, be humble, and offer to help others around you.
        - “In any given moment we have two options: to step forward into growth or back into safety.” -Abraham Manslow

#### Session 2: Managing Cognitive Resources
Gear-Up Session 2 2/1/17
Cognitive Resources:

Notes during the session: "Tiny Cognitive Cracks"--they add up. Try not to think about things that deplete all your resources. There is one bucket/tank for resources + willpower + willingness. Using willpower depletes cognitive resources. Being at 'high expertise' is often correlated with a 'high cognitive load'. How to get better at managing cognitive resources?

My mentor said: "move things into background noise". Which echoes the video we watched which makes a similar claim to 'move things from bucket A to C--into the mastered category. Bucket A: Can't Do. Bucket B: Can Do With Lots of Effort. Bucket C: Mastered task. How to bypass the 'pile-up' of tasks in Bucket B? The chick sexers example was given, and it reminded me of Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers where people are experts (at their given field) but can't pinpoint exactly why, other than the fact that they often have well over 10,000+ hours of expertise in that area. The video goes on to say that high-quality, very-high-quantity in a compressed amount of time is a template to move from A-C (while bypassing B). If possible, build a BIG library of small/diverse (excellent) examples.

Think about the process of managing the learning process:

1) What efforts do you make to manage the learning process? Challenges?

Trying to filter out noise and distractions. Focusing on a task for ~ 30 minutes, and then taking a break. Challenges: school demands, and dividing attention amongst a multitude of tasks. Having to stop, switch gears. Not getting tunnel vision while learning, and understanding where diminishing returns start.

2) The current process of banging my head over an over when I hit a 'speed-bump' isn't constructive. Need to focus on moving things from the 'Can't Do' bucket into the mastered bucket more quickly. I get bogged down in 'B' by not knowing what to focus on, or what the hierarchy of 'must-do' tasks are.

3) Emotional state: This matters a ton. Having small successes (going up on a roller coaster) and then failures (going down on the roller coaster/hitting the bottom) and then back up again--this emotional state isn't a stable one for learning. When learning fluctuates a lot between successes/failures: this can take up cognitive resources. Learning how to focus on key areas that need to be focused on, while not stressing about 'doing everything' can help make that roller coaster more gentle, and free up some cognitive resources to focus on the tasks at hand.

"Compare yourself to yesterday, not anyone else". I think that is important when deciding where to place resources.

#### Session 3: Managing Stress
Gear-Up Session 3 2/10/17
Managing Stress

1) example where Growth-Mindset is challenged
2) Helpful for Growth-Mindset
3) What "I" need

1) How I have been challenged by growth mindset in the past week: Getting something to work (while coding) and then running into a maze of walls. The up/down emotional roller coaster has challenged my "Growth Mindset".
2) Growth Mindset has helped: Something I learned from a former-military professor in grad school is that when that alarm blares in the morning: do not hit snooze, immediately plant your feet on the floor, stand up, and face your day regardless of whatever is going on in your life. I think there is something to be said for showing up, and continuing to show up day in and day out.
3) I need more encouragement, and less chaotic day-to-day.
Managing stress for weeks 4-6:
- silence the "I can't" voice
- check-in with myself more often (taking a pulse-check on how things are going, a big-picture check-in)
- setting aside some time for a 'weekly action plan', and then spending a few minutes each morning re-visiting what was planned, and then revising a more constructive 'daily outline' and tracking milestones set.
- Making more time for 'daily push-ups in code'--drills, exercises, manipulating data structures
- make time to step away from the computer and decompress
- short getaways to the mountains (leave the city) to relieve stress/recharge the batteries

#### Session 4: Personal Stories & Connection
Gear-Up Session 4 02/15/17
Personal Stories & Connection

What elements/lens do I see the world in? Personal-responsibility | Connectedness | Empathy

1) What brought you here? A desire to better myself, and the planet. Not in a 'world peace' sense, but I see some very cool technology tools that have helped address some major systemic social & environmental issues facing the world. I am a big fan of social ventures, and creating solutions that target the market of 'The Bottom Billion'.
2) Lens that I view the world? The words of a close friend from my days in Spain once told me: that I feel most alive when I am in motion. What that friend was referring to--I come alive when I am traveling, and seeking other places, and connecting with others. I enjoy learning about other cultures and connecting with those that are different than I am--as the differences are smaller than the similarities. I enjoy conversing with people from wildly-different backgrounds than mine and discussing solutions to real-world problems.
3) Values that drive me: I value Mobility (in an cross-border/international sense), Connection with others (sharing), and Autonomy (personal-responsibility). While I am fiercely independent, I enjoy sharing my resources with others, as when you share your knowledge you further someone else's, and (hopefully) that comes back full-swing. Hoarding things never made sense to me.
4) I try to put myself in others' shoes.
5) I have had people tell me things that I wasn't cognizant of, but are consistent (those actions) with my values. I think there is an inherent bias of how we perceive ourselves (as well as others), but I have had (multiple) people from different continents tell me that I enjoy sharing my resources and I enjoy helping others (in whatever capacity that I am able to). If I am not able to be helpful, I will try my best to connect that person with someone I know who is better suited to the task. I have had people tell me I am a 'Connector'--this is again in reference to Malcolm Gladwell, but in this case his 'The Tipping Point' book where he expands upon personality types he has identified.
