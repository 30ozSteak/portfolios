## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (Flashcards)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mariastenquist/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards)

(description): A flashcard program that is used through the command line. 

(evaluation comments): 
Talked about edge case testing and small other testing
Got through IT6 and working on extension (almost up and running)
Nice syntax and breakdown of logic

(evaluation scores): 

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

2. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

3. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

5. Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.
