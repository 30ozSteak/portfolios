# Maria Stenquist - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to understand how the Ruby object model, data structures, algorithms, and objects/methods that we focused on during module 1 fit into the bigger-picture for a web application. I wanted to focus on being a contributing member for our group projects, and to help other classmates as well. I was eager to see how ActiveRecord, a postgres database, and rails interact and it was exciting to see these moving pieces come together on a browser. I really enjoyed working with my teammates on group projects, and I learned so much from them.

## C: Group Work & Projects

**Bike Share** 
* Description: Bike Share was our first group project of the module, and we used Sinatra, Ruby, and ActiveRecord to build out functionality for a bike sharing program based in San Francisco. We used open-source data points held in large CSV files.

* Takeaways: Our team quickly realized the value of using fixtures instead of using the entire seed file, as well as the advantages of using ActiveRecord queries instead of iterating over every single record using Ruby enumerables. Our team also chose to use a front-end framework for the styling, Material Design Lite, and we customized certain elements in CSS.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  * From Joseph: Maria:
Working with you on this project was a pleasure. It's clear that you design a project with the end in mind, and our BikeShare app was much stronger for that. We really benefited from your front-end expertise and your good-natured approach to every challenge. I can't think of any areas for improvement except to say don't sell yourself short. You are clearly a talented programmer with strong skills in front **and** back-end development. When you drove in BikeShare we knocked out a full set of CRUD requirements with clean, concise code. If you're ever nervous, remember being unfamiliar with a framework isn't the same as being bad at it. Dive in and you'll see that you're every bit as capable as the best in our module. Thanks for being a good teammate as well as a good programmer. I really admire how you always know when we should ask for help. I struggle with that, and I learned a lot from how it saved time, made our project smoother and maximized our learning. You were also so supportive and ready to pair and talk through anything. Those skills will be an asset to every team you work on. Â¡Gracias por la ayuda!
    
  * From Jack: Working on this project with you was a really fun process for me. You have a really strong ability to work in a team, and to keep the team on track. I think that your really underestimate yourself sometimes. Don't be so modest, you are good at this. I have a hard time thinking of areas for improvement for you, which I think is a really good sign!

## D: Professional Skills

Intro

#### **Professional Development Workshops** [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/maria_stenquist.md)

#### **Gear Ups**
 [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently>

  That empathy towards others during a very high-stress environment (such as Turing) is a very important trait/skill to have as classmates. It can be a challenge to express empathy when individuals are stressed out and sleep deprived, however I have learned that it has helped me to reach out to others that are struggling as well and to provide emotional support. Empathizing and listening to others' stories has helped me put things in perspective, and have changed my outlook/strategy towards the program. Diversity is good: our backgrounds bring different strengths to the table, but we should focus on inclusivity as we are all in this together. 

 [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
- How did your grit come into play? Thinking about long-term future goals that I am passionate about. Looking ahead to the idea of working on projects that I find interesting, and am passionate about. Turing is part of the journey to achieving those goals.
- Have you been able to strengthen your grit (or your grittiness) in your time at Turing? Well, I am still here at Turing so I am motivated to come here and try my best. It has been helpful to focus on my journey and not compare myself to others. That can lead to 'unproductive' stress and clutters some brainpower/cognitive resources. 
- Is it in any way problematic to think about challenges through the lens of grit (ex: emphasizing pushing through when you really need a break)? Yes--stopping and walking away from something gives a respite that can often help productivity/efficiently, rather than constantly being switched 'on' and burning-out through lengthy code sessions. Also, if you are really not enjoying something, you may need to shift your focus towards something that you are passionate about (whether that is a long-term goal), or re-evaluating what it is that you are doing that you aren't enjoying. 

 [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

 This is an interesting concept, and I think it will be something that will continue to follow humanity in the future. Just as computers have become commonplace, and have become a necessity for a large subset of people that go to work everyday and turn on their computers/laptops, there may be robots/other automatic processes that become part of every day life. This isn't something that I am worried about, as that won't accomplish much, and there are no guarantees in life (as a trajectory). Rather than view this pessimistically, I am optimistic for innovative tools and processes, and I hope there is some 'good' that comes out of these new inventions. It is within some of our parents/grandparents/great-grandparents lifetimes that we made such inventions as being able to soar through the sky in an airplane, put a man on the moon, made great medical advances, gone from record players to cassettes to CD's to streaming music. We have gone from giant computers that would fill a room to ones that fit in everybody's pocket since I was born. Part of the reason that I chose to Turing was to learn an important skillset and keep my skills 'current'. There are lots of unfilled jobs in a variety of STEM fields: from cybersecurity to data science, from software engineers to geospatial scientists, and AI and embedded hardware. I foresee during my career that it may be necessary to, once again, 'keep my skills current' by learning a new-skillset that may not exist today. Bring it on! 


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  * For \<Jack Pincus>: Jack! It was awesome to work with you on Bike Share! You definitely were the 'rock' of the group, and you definitely kept the energy levels up in our group. I really enjoyed your awesome anecdotes and the 'comic relief' you provided during (much needed) breaks. On the technical side, you were always thinking one-step-ahead as far as driving the project forward, and I think you had a really good big-picture idea of the scope of the project as we moved forward. Despite being very technically-strong, you were always willing to stop and explain a concept to me, or help clear up something that I did not understand, and you did so in a very patient and kind manner. You made sure that all of us in the group were on the same page, and that each of us felt that we were valuable & contributing group members. We could count on your knowledge to get through small speed-bumps and your strengths definitely include tracking data structures, good ol' Ruby, and ActiveRecord queries. Furthermore, you were always eager to try new things and weren't afraid to go down rabbit-holes, and I think this will serve you well in your career as a developer. As a community member, your enthusiasm, and eagerness to help others makes you a great Turing community member, and I hope we get to work together again!
  
  * For \<Joseph Glass>: Joseph! We didn't get a chance to work together during module 1, but I was really glad that we finally got to work on Bike Share together. During the deluge of new topics being thrown at us, you took a very methodical and patient approach to working through the project. Your demeanor during the project was very calm, empathetic, and you were always driving the project forward. Also, you were very in-tune with how others were feeling in the group and as such you were empathetic towards us. You are a rockstar at calmly & collectedly battling errors, and your technical strengths during the project include TDD, quickly learning RSpec, and ActiveRecord methods. I had fun CRUDing out the last component of the project with you--I think the CRUD finally stuck after that point! In addition, whenever I had a question about a piece of functionality, or I was struggling to understand a concept, you would always stop to take the time to patiently explain to me what was going on, or to resolve a disconnect that I had. Further, as a community member your non-judgement and acceptance of others really makes you a valuable Turing student! I look forward to seeing all the awesome projects you contribute to as a software developer, y tengamos que practicar espaÃ±ol un dÃ­a pronto!

#### **Posse**
  * \Hamilton Posse! The focus of the posse was to work on Turing-related projects that benefit the Turing community. The focal point for this inning was the Wellness Tracker app, and another project spearheaded by a student in Hamilton was to have a Turing booth at the upcoming Pride Fest (in June). 
  
  * \How supportive all the students were, and I learned a ton from some talented ladies that took on the Wellness Tracker.  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>

#### **Playing a Part**

 I have contributed to the Turing community through being an active member of the Hamilton Posse. in addition, I have held some one-on-one pairings with other students to discuss the 'start' of the job search by providing contacts, providing a frame for narrowing down interests/passions/industry focus, and reviewing/revising resumes. When I am at Turing on the weekends, I make it a point to tidy up one area of the school (sometimes emptying the dishwasher, other times recycling things that are left in the classroom, etc). I am always available to provide emotional support to other students, whether that is lending an ear, walking around the block, or thinking of other ways to improve the situation. I have really enjoyed the Turing Diversity lunches (especially while enjoying the sun at the park!). Module 1 (both times) was an emotional rollercoaster for me, so I have reached out to a few module 1 students to help provide support. 

##### Peer/Community Feedback:

 From Amara Lovato: Maria is an excellent member of the Turing community. She is always eager to help other people providing whatever is needed. If she hears that you are struggling with something, she doesnât think twice and offers all her attention and time, plus she checks on you afterwards to make sure that your problem is solved or you are feeling better. She leads Hamilton posse, actively participates in Turing Diversity group and itâs also involved in many other non-official initiatives in the community. She is knowledgeable but humble what makes her even a better developer and an amazing person to work with. She is a wonderful person, honestly, a jewel of Turing. She will be a great ambassador to empower other women to join tech and make a positive change in the world for sure.
