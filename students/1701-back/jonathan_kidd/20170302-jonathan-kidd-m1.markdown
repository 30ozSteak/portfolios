## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](https://gist.github.com/jk1dd/0ad3c6feaa5f38aed29789999568b5fc) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (First Last): Riley Thompson

You were very organized, and possessed a strong attention to detail. Took the initiative to schedule many different pairing sessions which were integral to the success of our project. You were fun to work with,  kept a serious, but also playful attitude even during frustrating stints, while remaining punctual and respecting my time.

*   Project 2 (First Last): lorem ipsum

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
##### Growth Mindset
Great message. I recognized I was raised more with a fixed mindset around academic endeavors (being labeled as "smart"), but growth in other areas (music, language). Though I recognize the signs better, I am still triggered into a fixed mindset space at the beginning of a new endeavor or project. I have found this can be mitigated by dealing with the thought pattern immediately ("I don't know this YET"), getting started right away (even if I don't know which way to go), and relying on my cohort to share in the struggle, reminding me I am not alone.

#### Session 2
##### Getting Better at Difficult Things
I dove more into the learning experience and my own strengths and weaknesses therein. I have tried to apply the idea of limited cognitive resources to prioritize what I spend my time doing. I also seek to break down problems into smaller bits, which helps me stay in a growth mindset and have smaller wins through time, focused on what I can improve one bite at a time. I think review and recall is of paramount importance to solidify new material, as is taking breaks and getting enough sleep. Again, growth mindset is very important, so getting in that mode and staying there through the struggle helps the learning process.

#### Session 3
##### Managing Stress and Coping Mechanisms
Unmanaged stress tends to manifest itself through attacks (self or others), and negative behaviors (avoidance or withdrawal). I tend to attack myself and practice avoidance behaviors (especially procrastination), though I also have an arsenal of healthy "off-ramps", or coping mechanisms: exercise, writing, meditating, and regular, healthy eating. To make sure I am able to take one of these "off-ramps," I need to frequently check in with myself, consciously check my stress level, and pre-empt any dangerous or damaging levels of stress.
