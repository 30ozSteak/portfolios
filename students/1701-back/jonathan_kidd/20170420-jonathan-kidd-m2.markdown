# Jonathan Kidd - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> This module, I set out to expand on the fundamental Ruby I learned in the first module, by constructing database-backed web-applications. I aimed to learn about the tools available for building such applications, and good practices in applying them. Additionally, I wanted to learn more about group work in larger team settings (four people), and how to improve git workflow and agile project management. By and large, I feel I succeeded in attaining these goals.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score (optional) |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 4 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 4 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 4 |

>* In most areas, I exceeded my own expectations, as I gained skill in both technical areas and personal balance. I was diligent about completing the homework each night, and was an active participant in class and group work.

| **Pairing Assessment** | 3.5 |
| **Written Diagnostic** | X |

>* Good confirmation of my areas of strengths as well as a few areas for improvement, especially regarding thinking through tests to ensure they are complete.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [Blog Post Goin Here](https://google.com)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> Blogger and Mix Master were great introductions to Rails. I found both projects enjoyable, and though they felt a bit overwhelming at first (especially with so many words to parse and follow), in retrospect they provided a great foundation for later, more independent work. Mix Master was also helpful getting me started down the path to using Heroku to host applications.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> Job Tracker and the Rails Mini Project were where my learning began to solidify. They were another chance to practice the basics (at first), and then led me to be more challenged with things like custom routes - which helped firm up the idea of how the MVC model works. Consuming the Giphy API was a fun challenge in my Mini Project, and I look forward to learning more.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**
>* Using Sinatra, our team of four built an app that analyzed and displayed data about a Bike Sharing program in San Francisco.
>* This was a chance to practice CRUD-ing resources and an introduction to the power of ActiveRecord. I found ActiveRecord queries to be the most challenging part of the project, as it was tempting to fall back on Ruby to get our calculations done, but it spurred me to take a greater interest in learning more ActiveRecord, and I think the way objects relate and can by queried by AR is much more solid now.

> **Little Shop of Orders**
>* Our team of four built a shop for 'mingled' animals, using Rails. The instructor acted as a Product Owner who delivered user stories in chunks, and also gave us feedback along the way.
>* This project was very enjoyable, as we were able to select our own 'product' to sell. The slightly more 'real-world' aspect of the project was also nice, as we were given the work to do in chunks, which helped our pace and quality of work.

Weather CRUD: solid

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* From Josh Thompson:

  >Jonathan. Really thoughtful and methodical. I most enjoyed pairing directly with you on Sunday and Tuesday. I’d encourage you to be more assertive with your ideas and directions. You’re very attentive to what your partner is thinking, but don’t ever give them so much space that you’re sacrificing some of your “own” time, i that makes sense.


  >* From Stephanie Bentley:

  >Jonathan: Thank you  for your even-keeled, calm and collected attitude throughout this project. For me, a challenging project coupled with group dynamics can elevate stress and anxiety levels quickly.  I appreciated your ability to stay focused and keep a cool head despite (what had the potential to be) overwhelming factors.

## D: Professional Skills

> This module I focused on further developing the interpersonal and project management skills that, in the workplace, are often as or more important than technical skills. I learned a great deal about feedback and examined how I come across, as well as how others view me. I also learned more about the Agile process, and had practice reaching out to strangers.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For Josh Thompson:

  >I am so glad you were on the team for this project - your willingness and skill to jump into problem, pry it out or whatever, was an enormous asset, and your calm, collected head in the face of any “problem” we ran into really helped me (and the team) keep things in perspective. One area you could work on in the future is finding a way to share what you learn/try independently with the group, even if just an overview of the rabbit hole and what did/didn’t work.


  >* For Stephanie Bentley:

  >You did a great job PM’ing this project, and it was a pleasure to work with you. I really appreciate the energy and resourcefulness you brought to the project - when we got stuck on something, your tenacity played a big role in getting us through. One thing you could focus on in the future is remaining calm in times of high stress.


  >* For Seth Moser:

  >I had a great  time working with you on this project. Our team was much better off having your quick problem-solving skills on board. I was especially impressed with your ability to apply concepts (from class, documentation, or wherever) to real-world problems. One thing you could focus on to be even more effective would be finding a way to more clearly communicate your thought-processes to everyone else in the group, walking through step by step.
