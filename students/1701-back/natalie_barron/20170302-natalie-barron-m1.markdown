### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Sam Landfried): I want to thank you for a successful week of collaboration. You helped me achieve my goal of starting a project with a top-down approach â€” looking at the big picture idea before executing. You also kept us organized, and I feel like I learned a lesson about the value of budgeting time from you. It was also a relief to have frequent, frank conversations about our collaboration. That level of communication was helpful in navigating new terrain for both of us. To repeat a bit from one of those conversations, I think you would be well served by cementing a strong, fundamental understanding of Ruby, and it sounds like you're taking steps to achieve that. For future collaboration, continuing to be assertive with your needs will be helpful to any group, I'm sure. I'm proud of the work we did together, and I like that we executed a unique solution to the challenge, which was your brainchild. I look forward to seeing more cool ideas from you and just hanging out around Turing. Feel free to reach out if you ever want another pair of eyes on your code.
