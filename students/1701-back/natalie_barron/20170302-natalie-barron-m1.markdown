### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Sam Landfried): I want to thank you for a successful week of collaboration. You helped me achieve my goal of starting a project with a top-down approach â€” looking at the big picture idea before executing. You also kept us organized, and I feel like I learned a lesson about the value of budgeting time from you. It was also a relief to have frequent, frank conversations about our collaboration. That level of communication was helpful in navigating new terrain for both of us. To repeat a bit from one of those conversations, I think you would be well served by cementing a strong, fundamental understanding of Ruby, and it sounds like you're taking steps to achieve that. For future collaboration, continuing to be assertive with your needs will be helpful to any group, I'm sure. I'm proud of the work we did together, and I like that we executed a unique solution to the challenge, which was your brainchild. I look forward to seeing more cool ideas from you and just hanging out around Turing. Feel free to reach out if you ever want another pair of eyes on your code.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
(Week 1 Gear Up: Growth Mindset

How do you think past experiences or experiences this week have encouraged growth or fixed mindsets?

This week I have experienced fixed mind set when I felt overwhelmed and when I started to think "I can't do this". I had a growth mindset when Beth told us that we are all capable and we wouldn't be here if we couldn't do it.

What are your triggers, what is likely to move you to a fixed mindset?

Stress and distress are my triggers.

What can your peers do to support you staying in the growth mindset?

Encouragement helps, working together helps, talking through problems, brainstorming, pairing, and supporting each other.)

#### Session 2
(Week 2 Gear Up: Getting Better at Doing Difficult Things

This concept introduces new ideas about the awareness of your learning.

What effort do you make to manage your learning process? What challenges have you faced?

I try to stay organized, highlighting areas that I need to review. I feel like because we cover so much material, it's hard for me to master any one thing before moving on to the next topic.

How do Sierra's and Coate's material relate to your current process for learning?

I think the process of learning ruby by continuing to learn even though you haven't really master the previous subject relates to their material. I found the information and research about perceptive learning really fascinating. Perceptive learning is completely applicable in a coding environment because some of things we do is really all muscle memory.

What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?

I have to try to dissociate my emotions from the learning process here at Turing because it's easy to feel panic about not knowing the material or mastering it before moving in to the next subject. It helps to just keep pushing through and not thinking about the stuff you haven't mastered yet.)

#### Session 3
(Week 3 Gear Up: Managing Stress

When have you been challenged by growth mindset?

Working on my pair project was a challenge to growth mindset because my partner was more advanced in Ruby and it made me feel like I was falling behind and it affected my growth mindset.

What way has growth mindset helped you?

Growth mindset has helped me keep going even though I lost confidence in myself. It helped me to reach out to my instructors to validate where I am in my learning path and identify areas that need improvement.

What do you need to help you be better with keeping a growth mindset?

I need to keep a positive attitude and not give up. I also need support from friends, family, and instructors through encouragement and feedback. Lastly I need to stop comparing my path to the path of others.

Ways that I deal with stress: talking to family and friends, exercise, music, yoga, walks, happy hour

Proactive plan to manage stress in the next 3 weeks:

  doing well: daily walks, venting, personal time, self assessment, music

  need improvement: not enough sleep, not enough exercise, scheduling, time management)

#### Session 4
(Week 4 Gear up: Personal Stories & Connection

This gear up highlighted that everyone is different but we actually have a lot more in common than not. The Turing community values diversity and everyone's unique perspective adds value to our cohort. There was a running theme of core values that were collectively shared by the group and those were respect, empathy, and hard work. It's important to remember that our cohort is a team and the relationships we are building may become strained at times because of the stressful learning environment at Turing but understanding our core values will help us navigate through difficulties. This will also help prepare us for interactions with people after Turing.)

#### Session 5
(Week 5 Gear up: Debugging the gender gap!

This movie really resonated with me and my experiences as a woman in tech. It's so important to recognize that these issues exist. It's very difficult to address a problem that the collective industry doesn't or hasn't acknowledged. I really enjoyed the class discussion after watching the movie. It was interesting to hear everyone's opinions and also see how supportive the people in our cohort are. This session demonstrated the mission of Turing.)

### Community Participation
(I have contributed to the Turing community by becoming involved in several student groups including Joan Clark Society, Impostors, and Turing Diversity. I am planning to co-run the Impostors group with Erin Bassity going forward. I would also like to volunteer to help at either a try Turing or kids who code event during next mod.)
