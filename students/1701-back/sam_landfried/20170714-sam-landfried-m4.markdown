# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?
- I want to focus on getting a job.
- I want to leave Turing with a solid portfolio and set of PD materials (resume etc.)

## Assessment

Outcome: PASS

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Rembering how to use Rails after working in JavaScript for a month.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
It was a meaningful assessment in that completing it demonstrated proficiency as a developer. I finished it and was like, 'Yep, I built a thing.'
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I stuck to the prescribed iterations in the markdown. I broke iteration 1 into tiny steps, completed them, then moved to 2. 
* What did you learn?
The fetch API and vanilla JavaScript are not as semantic or powerful as jQuery. 

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
- Understanding promises.
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
- I secured some instructor time to discuss promises in detail.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
- Building out a frontend from scratch was fun.
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
1. Event delegation
1. Testing with Selenium
1. How frontend/backend fits together

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
- I would have added a 'enabled' column to my foods so I could have taken them off the master food list without removing them from diaries. 
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
- I worked solo. In the past, learning something new with pairs has been rewarding.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Authenticating my users was a much bigger challenge than it should have been. I spent 3 days setting up Auth0 (And it probably could have been 1 if I had spent more time in the docs).
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
I figured out Auth0 by a lot of trial and error and reading docs. Finally, I realized it wasn't appropriate for my use case, so I handrolled my own solution.
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
I liked the time to focus on my own project and to finally put together a usable web app. 
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
I learned the HTML Drag and Drop API, React and AWS EC2. 

## Feedback

I was told that because I'm 30 and don't have any dependents, it makes sense to take a high risk/reward job. If I'm given that opportunity, I'll take it. 

## Gear Up

The gear up session went well. I enjoyed working with my partners and getting to know a frontender. The new students were engaged, and I think they got some value from the experience. To me, the most rewarding aspect of it was getting to contribute to the Turing community.

## Community Involvement

I was one of the coleaders of Beryllium BE. I paired with some Mod 1 students. I helped out some classmates with JavaScript since I'd had exposure to it in the past.

## Going Forward

I'm going to work on building personal relationships whereever I wind up. I'm going to try to be honest with myself about my own best interests when making decisions. I'm going to keep using Vim.
