# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I've been focusing on improving my macro approach to projects by whiteboarding, then writing tests, then pseudocoding, and only putting code to IDE when I feel confident about the relationships between the various components of a project. I've also focused on writing code that is more "Rubyish". I have a JavaScript background, and I realize that while it is totally possible to accomplish the same thing in Ruby using a very similar approach as I would with JS, the strength of Ruby comes from community conventions that emphasize readability above all else.

#### Notes

Night Writer notes from Beth
*    Really cool implementation of alphabet key -- great work! In future, look to set up this code so it's more readable
*    Works through one extension
*    Some really long methods -- refactoring will help in future
*    Would like to see clearer distinctions between classes

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1 - Growth Mindset
Culturally, we tend to operate with a fixed mindset. Only outcomes are praised, struggle is a sign of weakness and your current situation predicts your future success. While this is the attitude and mindset that we learn in school and many jobs, it is not the only way to think about the world, and it is certainly not helpful in learning a new school. Objectively, it is impossible to improve a skill, and the process of improving that skill is often stressful and uncomfortable. Applauding that struggle, embracing that hardship as an indication of progress will make our time here more enjoyable and productive.

#### Session 2 - Cognitive Resources
We are creatures with physical limitations that everyone acknowledges: We need food, air, sleep, shelter. It is a less common notion that we are also limited mentally by a finite supply of focus, concentration or just cognitive resources for lack of a better word. We expend our cognitive resources on every task that can't be accomplished through impulse and habit. So, for example, restricting what you eat to improve your health will drain your cognitive tank until that behavior is ingrained to the point of habit. This is important to remember since we have dived into a new environment with new expectations and challenges, which means that virtually everything will initially drain our cognitive resources. A person drained of those resources will fall back on operating purely on habit and impulse, so that's dangerous if your success relies on behaving in a new way (Creating a server, for example). The two solutions are moving new tasks into the category of learned behaviors that can be handled through habit, so with less cognitive drain, or strengthening your cognitive resources. Or do both. That's probably best.

#### Session 3 - Stress Management
Stress left unchecked can make us do dumb things. Common responses to stress fall on the spectrums of attacking others or attacking ourselves and withdrawing from the world or avoiding problems. Since we're intentionally ramping up our stress levels to learn a new skill, it's reasonable that we ensure we're taking precautions to preemptively manage stress, or derail it when we feel it's getting unmanageable. Preemptive techniques fall under the umbrella of Handle Your Shit while emergency-derailing maneuvers are varied. I settled on, if I feel that I'm about to do something dumb because of stress, disconnecting from whatever I'm doing and going to a movie at a theater and buying a big bucket of popcorn.

#### Session 4
(insert reflection summary here)

### Community Participation
I've done my best to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Turing community. I'm participating in the Bezos posse, Monday productivity lunches and Wednesday morning guided meditation. I've attended all Friday guest speakers and try to take advantge of whatever spike is most compelling. I've connected with a mentor through Turing, as well.

I'm trying to contribute to the community, as well. I led a remote meetup to go over recursion, I started a daily meditation group, and I volunteered to give a lightning talk to the school. I try to make myself available to help any cohort mates that might have questions about material I've got a grasp on.
