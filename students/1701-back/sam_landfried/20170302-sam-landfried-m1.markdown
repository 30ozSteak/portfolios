# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I've been focusing on improving my macro approach to projects by whiteboarding, then writing tests, then pseudocoding, and only putting code to IDE when I feel confident about the relationships between the various components of a project. I've also focused on writing code that is more "Rubyish". I have a JavaScript background, and I realize that while it is totally possible to accomplish the same thing in Ruby using a very similar approach as I would with JS, the strength of Ruby comes from community conventions that emphasize readability above all else.

#### Notes

* Night Writer notes from Beth
Really cool implementation of alphabet key -- great work! In future, look to set up this code so it's more readable
Works through one extension
Some really long methods -- refactoring will help in future
Would like to see clearer distinctions between classes

### Community Participation
I've done my best to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Turing community. I'm participating in the Bezos posse, Monday productivity lunches and Wednesday morning guided meditation. I've attended all Friday guest speakers and try to take advantge of whatever spike is most compelling. I've connected with a mentor through Turing, as well.

I'm trying to contribute to the community, as well. I led a remote meetup to go over recursion, I started a daily meditation group, and I volunteered to give a lightning talk to the school. I try to make myself available to help any cohort mates that might have questions about material I've got a grasp on.
