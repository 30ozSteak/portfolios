# Victoria Vasys - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to become proficient at Ruby (writing succinct & conventional code), comfortable with creating singularly-responsible classes and methods, and be able to keep up with rest of class content while still being able to participate in interesting extracurriculars & stay healthy.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Sergey Lukyanenko): lorem ipsum
  * For Sergey: 
  It was really nice working with you! I think we balanced each other out in many helpful ways, but I especially appreciated your ability to know when to step away, take breaks, refresh & re-gather. It really helped to have you brainstorm & sketch out the way you saw different aspects of the project going & helped us keep the important stuff at the forefront. Your positive attitude really helped me step out of some serious and/or frustrating moments & it felt really good to have celebrations for every little accomplishment we made! I think you would benefit from diving into Ruby docs and getting some more understanding of various methods, especially for Enumberables (although we only *just* started learning those, so don't feel like you're behind or anything!) I would highly recommend doing exercises whenever (or if ever...) you have free time. I think we could both use more practice in Object Oriented Programming, especially with single-responsibility (less daisy-chaining)-- so if you find good resources on practice with that, I'd really appreciate links! Thanks for being such a great collaborator, encouraging me be more outgoing in asking questions & keeping us on task; I think we both learned a lot & it was a great first paired programming experience! Well done, sir! :)
  * From Sergey: You were a great asset to the team. You are very professional and focused on your work. Despite the difficult deadlines for the Night Writer Project, you maintained a positive attitude. You responded to problems without getting frustrated. You often stayed late working and were very conscientious of timelines and resources. When fixing a problem, you readily explained how you were fixing it. One thing to possibly improve in your skills is dividing responsibilities of the project parts with your team, allowing your partner to be more involved in coding of the project. It has been wonderful working with you and I hope I get the chance to work with you again in the future.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1 - Growth Mindset
I thought it was really valuable speaking with other students (especially front-enders) about their current feelings and how they've experienced Turing so far. I think the most important things we discussed that will help to inspire a growth mindset are: not being afraid to ask questions, taking time to teach things we've learned, and fostering a culture of empathy & collaboration. I think it'll be really helpful to have a simple concept to keep in mind to provide comfort when feeling overwhelmed or stuck and to keep me on track and challenge myself IF I'm ever feeling comfortable :)

#### Session 2 - Getting Better at Difficult Things
I thought that the idea of cognitive resource management was the most interesting thing about the Gear Up. Knowing that there are tons of things in my "A" column that I can't do but need to is both daunting and exciting, but it's also reassuring that those things don't really burn my cognitive resources. I know that things are going to start accumulating in my "B" column, so it's useful to have strategies to keep it from clogging up (skip to "C" by learning from experts, break down bigger objectives into smaller skills-learning & practice a high quantity of high quality examples). It's also nice to realize that I have a few life skills on "C" that I can and will use in my life as a programmer. I will definitely try to keep this catalogue of my skills in mind & make sure to do what I can to keep things from piling on "B" & to check-in with & enhance the things on "A." The article was also useful in reminding me that I need to celebrate the small victories; attitude is important and losing hope only feeds the fatigue (adds to cognitive leaks that affect both processing & willpower). Plugging up those cognitive leaks whenever possible will help to build focus & learning. 

#### Session 3 - Managing Stress
The most helpful parts of this session were: the chance to reflect on & reinforce our growth mindsets, fueling new ideas for dealing with stress & the opportunity to make an action plan for how to limit stress. I didn't really understand the graph of avoidance versus withdrawal & I'm still unclear why those are opposites, but the concept of "off-ramps" is helpful to keep in mind. It would have been nice to share how we handled the past stressful situation we reflected on, but that was kind of swallowed up by off-ramp ideation. I enjoyed seeing other people's ideas through the poster-sharing; although there were a lot of the ideas that I have seen & tried before, there were a few good ideas that I don't usually go to in stressful situations (and one completely foreign one, RPDR, which made me chuckle when I later found out was Rupaul's Drag Race) & I realized I really need to break my own ice with comedy when I get really stress. I'm definitely better at actively incorporating things if I make a schedule for myself, so I made an action plan to manage daily stress by: stretching every day, singing in my car at least one way to or from the park-n-ride every weekday, exercising on Mondays, Thursdays & Saturdays, and taking a bath on Tuesdays. I will also continue to listen to funny & educational podcasts in my car, spend at least a couple meals a week with my boyfriend, and go hiking when I have enough time. And I need to work on making a good playlist of hilarious YouTube videos that I can go to when stress is really high.

### Community Participation
(insert description of how you've contributed to the Turing community)
I've attended Joan Clarke Society panels and discussions, participated in all of the Friday events, attended the Demo Competition night, participated in lunch roulettes, attend Pahlka Posse lunches. I've been to productivity lunches, the jobs-working hour Monday mornings, went to the Denver RB meetup, go to Turing Game Time lunches, and I try to help others with their work whenever possible. Write a blog post? Go Code Colorado Brainstorming. Am in contact with professional & life mentors. Participate in pairing.
