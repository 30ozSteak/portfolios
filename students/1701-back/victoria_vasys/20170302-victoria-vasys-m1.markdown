# Victoria Vasys - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to become more proficient at Ruby, more succinct in writing code, and be able to keep up in classes & do the extracurriculars

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1 - Growth Mindsest
I thought it was really valuable speaking with other students (especially front-enders) about their current feelings and how they've experienced Turing so far. I think the most important things we discussed that will help to inspire a growth mindset are: not being afraid to ask questions, taking time to teach things we've learned, and fostering a culture of empathy & collaboration. I think it'll be really helpful to have a simple concept to keep in mind to provide comfort when feeling overwhelmed or stuck and to keep me on track and challenge myself IF I'm ever feeling comfortable :)

#### Session 2 - Getting Better at Difficult Things
I thought that the idea of cognitive resource management was the most interesting thing about the Gear Up. Knowing that there are tons of things in my "A" column that I can't do but need to is both daunting and exciting, but it's also reassuring that those things don't really burn my cognitive resources. I know that things are going to start accumulating in my "B" column, so it's useful to have strategies to keep it from clogging up (skip to "C" by learning from experts, break down bigger objectives into smaller skills-learning & practice makes permanent, so do a high quantity of high quality examples). It's also nice to realize that I have a few life skills on "C" that I can and will use in my life as a programmer. I will definitely try to keep this catalogue of my skills in mind & make sure to do what I can to keep things from piling on "B" & to check-in with & enhance the things on "A." The article was also useful in reminding me that I need to celebrate the small victories; attitude is important!! Both media helped to reinforce the idea that emotions play a big role & that your cognitive resources house both processing and willpower, so it's important to plug up those cognitive leaks when you can.
