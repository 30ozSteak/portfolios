# \<Mark Stover> - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> \<This mod I set out to learn more about creating and consuming API's. It was also my hope to help solidify my understand of SQL and Active Record queries. I gained loads of understanding in both areas.>

## Self-Assessment

>* \<My take away from this module has been the importance of creating and consuming API's. It seems likely that as a backend developer it is likely that my professional work will require these skills.>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/stovermc/APICurious)**
>* \<This Project uses Github's api to recreate a logged in user's view of their profile page.>
>* \<It took awhile for me to dial in my postman queries but once I gained proficiency, the application really came together. I really enjoyed breaking logic into poro's to handle the API requests.>


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/stovermc/rales_engine)**
>* \<In this project, we used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.>
>* \<Takeaways, your experience>

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/stovermc/punstartr)**
>* \<In this project, we built a clone of Dropbox from scratch to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users & admins)>
>* \<The sheer volume of work needed to be done in order to create an MVP was a bit overwhelming. I really enjoyed the early discussions regarding general app architecture and database schema considerations. This being the largest team I have been on, it was neat to see the high volume of code produced in two week sprint.>

> Cloney Island Sprint 1 evaluation comments:
\<* Really nice work with an unfamiliar topic!>
\<* Would like to see more of a stretch to test the message controller and/or at least validations on the new models.>
\<* Quite a few unused else statements. Some small refactoring but overall, nice job!>

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
\<This gear up has made me continue to consider the implications of my remarks through the lens of intent vs. impact. I feel I would never consciously make a remark to offend someone.>

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently>

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
\<3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently>


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>

#### **Posse**
  >* \<During this inning, the Turing labs posse spent most of its time working with the 3d printer. It was fun to see the software used to generate the g-code used to "drive" the printing head.>
  >* \<I really enjoyed being able to create a tangible object. We made fidget toys and it was cool to be able to play around with them.>
  >* \<My time with Turing labs has helped me feel more comfortable approaching problems that lie outside of my skill set. I feel this will help me professionally when I come across technologies that I am unfamiliar by giving me the confidence to approach the problem with a healthy enthusiasm.>

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<I have served my second term as a SAB rep. I feel this inning our retros were well facilitated and produced productive conversations. Also, I have been trying hard to make friends outside of our mod in hopes of stitching the Turing community closer together.>
