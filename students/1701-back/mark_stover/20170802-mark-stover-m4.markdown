## Area of Emphasis

> Coming from three mods of back-end learning, I am excited to gain a better understanding of the front-end. Specifically, I am interested in focusin on learning JavaScript and the benefits of using it to develop a front-end application. By graduation, I hope to have experience working on the whole stack. I want to gain understanding on how the back-end and front-end communicate and learn some common design patterns around this type of application. 

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
> The biggest technical challenge was learning to write JavaScript as the project evolved. By the time we learned about classes and refactoring, our code base was such a  tangled mess of functions that it was very difficult to unpack into single responsiblity entities. Had we gone into the project with a better understanding  of JavaScript, our overall architecture would have been much cleaner and eaiser to refactor as our application grew.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
> We were able to refactor some of our logic out of some massive functions but on the whole, given the timeline, our project was left in state that could benefit from a day of refactoring. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
> Though some of our functions were messy, it was really fun to just write as much code as was needed in order to complete a feature. In this way it was sort of liberating and really helped me gain a familiarity with JavaScript as a language.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
> In this project, I learned how to build an api using a node/Express backend. I learned how to consume the endpoints from a front-end application and lastly, I learned how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
> One thing I would change would be to take the time and better consider the architecture of our front-end application. Instead we just wrote features as required to get through our user stories. Better understanding each feature from the beginning would have given us a conceptual framework to develop within, improving the quality of our codebase.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
> It was awesome. It was great to have someone to brainstorm with when I got stuck and to have someone hold me accontable for my learning. We collabored very well the whole time and produced a very functional application. 

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
