### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Beth Knight):

Dear Erin,

Here is why you are amazing…

  You came in on the weekend to work with me.

  Our communication was completely open. I never felt like we butted heads. Instead, you listen and gave feedback like a champ.

  When we got stuck, you reached out to people. The file.io was incredibly hard and you took it on. I think you acknowledge where you are not clear and seek help.

Here is what you need to work on….

  Writing more code. I feel like I stole your learning by taking over most of night_writer.rb.

*   Project 2 (First Last): lorem ipsum
