#### Notes


*   Note 1: TDD in project was unable to execute due to an input file that was misnamed when we cleaned up our test data before turning in. We used TDD throughout the project, and going back 1 commit or changing the input file path makes it functional again. My feeling is that getting the same score as if I had not even written any tests is bad feedback at best, and a demoralizing personally.

## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Nicholas Jacques): 
Strengths
    + Really strong ability to turn algorthimic concepts into functional code.  I could suggest an idea and you would quickly implement it in the program.
    + Great time management, time spent coding was focused with few distractions.  
    + We figured out a basic github workflow. No catastrophes.
    + File IO master.
    + Overall a really positive pairing experience.
    
Opportunities for Improvement
    + Slow down and commit to TDD. We both struggled with this and probably enabled each other in neglecting it.  Once we tried to implement we made good progress.  We both clearly have a lot more too learn about TDD.
    + You might be able to combat overly-complicated-method syndrome by talking through these methods with your pair.  You have an impressive ability to make it "do the thing" but there were a few methods in our project that I never really got a full grasp of how they worked.  As you mentioned, I definitely should have been more proactive about speaking up when that occurred.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
Growth Mindset: In this session we talked about growth mindset vs fixed minset. Growth mindset is a way of thinking, and encouraging others to think in a way that encourages thoughts that lead to lifetime learning and expanding capabilities. Fixed mindset is a way of thinking that sees learning as heaving an endpoint, and the learning itself as the end ratgher than the newfoiund knowledge used to accomplish something.

#### Session 2
Getting better at difficult things. This session pointed out that the brain is often very efficient at parsing difficult tasks without active instruction. As far as I can tell the important part about 

#### Session 3
Stress. this session we talked about the triggers of stress, as well as the responses and actions that people can take to deal with stress. The important takeaway for me was that managing stress is critical, but even mor ecritical is managing stress in ways that are healthy for me and my world.

#### Session 4

### Community Participation
Particiapted in the Turing Lab Posse, and was invited to present my side project during a spike.
