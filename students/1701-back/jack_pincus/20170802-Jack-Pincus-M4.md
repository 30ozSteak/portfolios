# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

I came into the inning very much concentrating on the job hunt, and wanting to leave early. I realized how much there still was to learn and decided to instead concentrate on making a great Capstone and learning as much as I could about front-end and JS.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

#### What was your biggest technical challenge?
+ Working with asynchronous issues. This was also a project where I learned so much by the end of it, that I recognized that the code I started with was measurably awful.
#### How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
+ I ended up needing an external library. I was able to get things to fire in the right order, but I discovered that the issue was in the design of how the front and back end worked together. The front end was firing off requests faster than the back end could process them.
#### What did you like the most about the challenge?
+ I learned a lot about JS and how to use it all the way across the stack.
#### What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
+ Server side JS
+ Asynchronous JS
+ ES6 and OO JS
#### If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
+ Would have been smart to be more willing to reconfigure the back-end to match up with what the front end needed. In retrospect, there are a lot of things that the backend could have done to make the front end easier. There was probably too much logic in the front end.
#### What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
+ I really enjoyed it. I think that working in a pair, especially on new stuff, allows a lot of knowledge transfer that would otherwise take forever.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
