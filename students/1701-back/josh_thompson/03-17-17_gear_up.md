## Once finished reviewing the list, write in your notebook on these questions.

- What were some factors that you have never thought of before?

The majority (by number) of people in the world and the USA are functionally invisible to people that have power. The people in power don't notice the shit the rest of the world deals with, and can pretend it doesn't happen.

- What question made you think most? If you could add a question, what would it be?

- Select one of the statements that describes a seeming disadvantage that you would feel comfortable discussing.

> You would call the police if you felt the need

Police are nice to rich white people. (myself included). When they commit crimes against others, and all the other rich white people say "it's a bad apple", the conversation is over before it's begun.



- What did that/those experience(s) feel like?
- If you were trying to describe that experience to someone else, what would that person need to do to help you continue to feel connected/trusting of them, even if they didn't share the experience?
- Select one of the statements that describes a seeming advantage/privilege that you would feel comfortable discussing.
- What did that/those experience(s) feel like?
- If you were trying to describe that experience to someone else who hadn't shared that experience with you, how would that affect your trust with them? What could that person do to help you sustain trust? What could you do?


## Final Reflection

We'll take a few minutes to tie this really complex topic back to what we, as individuals, can do today to connect and do right by others who are affected by the disparities we discussed in groups. Remember, privilege is not a concept we're using to make individuals feel guilty, rather it is a framework in which we can better understand each other and stay connected in spite of widely varying experiences.

What is _my_ work to do?

Teach what I know, encourage others to feel confident in themselves. I have learned a lot about that, so rather than try to teach about what I don't know, I should just play to my strengths.
