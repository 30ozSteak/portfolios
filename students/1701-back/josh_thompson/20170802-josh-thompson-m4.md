# Josh Thompson - mod 4 portfolio



## Area of Emphasis

_What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?_

This inning, I really wanted to improve my front-end skills, specifically with updating a given page without reloading. Obviously, this draws on JavaScript, AJAX, and some jQuery. On day one, I had basically no idea how to implement this, though I was familiar with the theory of how to do it.

After all our different projects, I feel quite comfortable with this process. Not an expert, but I can do it.

I also wanted to go much deeper in Rails, and do all of this front-end stuff without page reloading in the context of a rails app. Success!

Oh, and job things.


## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* **What was your biggest technical challenge?**
* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**
* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**
* **What did you learn?**

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* **What was your biggest technical challenge?**

Switching stacks entirely left me little mental framework to rely upon. I understood Rspec and the HTTP request/response cycle, but everything else was foreign.

I would have preferred a project that kept me in Rails, and integrated AJAX and DOM manipulation before jumping stacks entirely to Node and Express. I didn't learn as much as I would have preferred, and wrote a bunch of crappy code.

* **How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?**

Unfortunately, just trial and error.

* **What did you like the most about the challenge?**

Modifying the page without a refresh.

* **What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?**

1. Type-ahead filtering, while highlighting the matched portion of the word.
2. AJAX calls based on the four HTTP verbs.
3. Writing better semantic HTML to let me find/modify elements later.


* **If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?**

Know some freaking Javascript before starting the project. That was my fault, no one elses.

* **What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?**

It was fine. I'm glad for the opportunity, I would have struggled much more without Colleen. She was more knowledgable than me, and was able to bring me up to speed on various concepts, instead of me just flailing. I was (and am) very thankful for her partnership.


## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

_What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?_

I bombed one of my technical challenges in a practice interview, so I spent a bunch of time brushing up on Ruby. I'd forgotten it all since mod 3.

## Gear Up

_Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?_

Planning the gear up was fine. I didn't feel strongly about it one way or the other. I've enjoyed spikes led by mod 4 students in the past, so I didn't mind doing the same thing as those students when in their shoes.

Nothing was particularly challenging. Ellen Mary did a great job of facilitating and supporting all of us.

We talked about "how to give back", and it was cool watching other's support of me (students one mod ahead) come full circle, as I've tried to help others, and then see them planning how to help students behind them.

I'm sure this trend will continue.

## Community Involvement

_How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?_

#### Learning Spike

Joseph Glass and I led a spike on [learing how to learn](), on the very first Friday of the mod.

We invited mods 1 && 2, and had a [ton of people turn up]().

We got lots of positive feedback, along the lines of

>this framework and these tools will substantively change how I approach learning at Turing

This was *exactly* what we wanted to accomplish, and it was cool to get to play a very small roll in the Turing experience of these 30 or 40 people.

#### Pairing w/students in other mods

I also spent some time in the other BEE classrooms for a few afternoons, to be available for quick questions and checkins. It wasn't _pairing_, per se, but I'd do work in there and always had a chance to help a few different students get unstuck.

(An easy example: one group had questions on how to setup their routes and controller to allow them to edit the contents of their shopping cart.)

## Going Forward

_What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?_

1. Writing detailed guides to things
2. AJAX && jQuery/JavaScript
3. Reading technical books
