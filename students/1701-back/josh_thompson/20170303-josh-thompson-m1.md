### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1: Night Writer (Seth Mo)

> Josh it was great you were able to meet before hand with me and set up our work schedule. It really helped that you were able to communicate well quickly understood new concepts. You could work on TDD and pseudocoding to help you make your programs better, and don't forget to take small breaks when working for really long periods of time. If you keep going how you are with those two small changes you'll be on a good track.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1

Growth mindset for the win! I'm not a fully-fledged, independently useful and valuable developer _yet_. Emphasis on the _yet_.


#### Session 2

How have I been challenged by the growth mindset concept? How do I rest and recharge?

1. Recognize difference between _distress_ and _eustress_. One can be bad, the other is good. Everything at Turing is, IMO, _eustress_. I've been mildly stressed a few times so far, but nothing more severe than that.
