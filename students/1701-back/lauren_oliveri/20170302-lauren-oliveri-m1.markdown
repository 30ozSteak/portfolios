### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Marc Fidelman):

Lauren Oliveri has a friendly proactive nature that supports organization and goal oriented project management.  She was very quick to establish logistical standards and came to the table prepared to define a professional relationship of growth and good will. Lauren’s curiosity and love of fun can keep a work session light but does not deter her from digging into the details of a challenge or confronting a problem. Her desire for a clear and habitual dialogue helped us maintain a strong work ethic and swift pivots when challenges arose. When asked, Lauren is comfortable revisiting her work and explaining thought process or functionality of a section she has accomplished on her own. This kind of patience was important for dealing with the imbalance in how comfortable we each were with ruby’s fundamentals. Lauren’s eagerness for problem solving can lead to running ahead. While it never turned into over reaching into parts of the project that we had divided it did mean unclaimed territory would sometimes be completed before it was discussed. In a learning setting getting something done and revisiting it may not hold the same learning opportunities as working on something as a pair.  In our feedback session Lauren was very receptive to the concept that checking in with more specificity could keep a partner in the loop and provide opportunities to synchronize goals and work rhythms.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
Even though this week has generally been pretty easy, I'm encouraged by the fact that staff is really open to questions and that Turing has created an environment where it's okay to be struggling. My last job did not appreciate failure and risk, they touted that outcomes and effort mattered, but that ended up not being the case.

I feel more open to feedback and even excited by evaluations. I can be a little triggered by grades (my type A personality comes out), when people state "oh I'm done with that" (makes me feel slow/incompetent), so I am trying to overcome the anxiety when I don't understand things or work at a slower pace. I know that it's okay.

#### Session 2: Getting Better At Difficult Things
I make an effort to work on challenging projects, extensions, and exercises by choice. However, this week I picked the "spiciest" of three individual projects to work on and came face-to-face with a concept I've never been exposed. I had no examples or help material to reference.

Coate's article that we reviewed in Gear Up definitely related to how I was feeling with the "Complete Me" project. Every small win, I try to savor instead of worrying about the errors and failures. Beth, our instructor, gave us a similar pep talk this week with reference to Ira Glass (I'm such a NPR/"This American Life" fan girl, too), where she assured us we're not doing things well, but we can do them. So we should stop using cognitive resources worrying about being the best/being perfect.

Siena's talk definitely encouraged me to continue drilling myself and working through lots of exercises to better master the material in manageable chunks. She's right in that I feel like there's already material that I've mastered (in my "C" pile!).

One of the biggest takeaways from Gear Up this week was that your "cognitive resources" and "willpower" come from the same "tank" in your brain, which makes sense why after a long day of keeping emotions bottled up and slogging through problems and projects that it's easy to fall out of sync with a healthy routine. I am being mindful of my own routine and emotional/mental/physical well-being, and ensuring I prioritize what makes me happy and healthy so that I can come to class every day energized and prepared to learn and work hard.

#### Session 3: Stress Management & Coping Mechanisms
I have been challenged by the "growth mindset" this past week grappling with the reality that my learning isn't finite. Just because I did the bare minimum requirements doesn't mean I've achieved mastery or ever really should/will. There's always more practice to be done and experiences to be had. The growth mindset has helped me be way more open to receiving, and even craving, feedback about how I can be a better coder and human being.

At Gear Up this week, we had to reflect upon one of the most stressful times in our lives and how we handled and coped with that stress. If I learned anything from my reflections, it's that I've never handled huge amounts of stress well.

One of the most stressful times for me occurred when one of my clients at CipherHealth had severe issues with their interface with our system, but the product manager who helped build the interface was on vacation. I had pretty much no executive support from any of the founders, and was swimming in client email complaints, phone calls, and had to manually fix a 10,000 patient census for 3 hours each day. And then try to write up what I thought the issue was for the developers.

During that time period, I'd work without breaks for long periods of time, order expensive, unhealthy delivery Thai food to my NYC apartment door, try to watch a couple of episodes of TV, and cutback on "non-essential" day-to-day tasks (mostly ones relating to self care). I didn't take enough breaks, didn't exercise, and isolated myself from friends and family. I also have a bad habit when I'm stressed of picking at my face... which causes acne... Anyway, it's all a mess.

During Turing, I've been way more mindful of stress and how I handle it. I'll stop myself from working too late, and it *always* pays off for me. I have been making sure to craft a routine that I'm comfortable sticking with even in times of stress, and always prioritize what is going to make me happy, because I learned the hard way that not taking care of yourself as a shortcut usually backfires and makes me less effective/productive. I also learned some other really good coping mechanisms and healthy strategies from others. I've participated in meditations with classmates, and know everyone knows I love taking walks on my breaks. I'm definitely going to look into other strategies, like a craft or activity I can work on in my spare time, like knitting or drawing, etc.
