### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Mark Van Akkeren):

      Feedback for Mark:

      You were a great partner to work with. I loved the overall flexibility and enthusiasm with working on the project. You had a good grasp on what we had to do and what the assessors were expecting from us. I think we both should have done a better job with TDD. We should have done more TDD from the beginning. Also, you made David Hasselhoff too skinny. You need to work on you ASCII conversion skills. Overall our communication was great between us and i liked your willingness to improve as well.

      Feedback from Mark:

      This went pretty smooth.  It would be interesting to work together again on a harder project, maybe at that point some difficulties or struggles might get sussed out but when the work is well within our current aptitudes there isn't a whole lot of flailing.  I was massively impressed with your familiarity in calling concise methods point by point when modifying data.  I'll take a lot away from that.  When you wanted to refactor my code you took the time to walk me thru it and help me with a better understanding of the process.  There ain't no shit here... because we finished so quickly, and refactored quickly you then were taking the time to help others out.  Only positive vibes.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset
This gear up was about the growth mindset. We learned about how people can learn subjects that they aren't originally good at if they keep a growth mindset over a fixed mindset. I think that growth mind set is really interesting. I learned about triggers that move me to a fixed mindset and things that encourage a growth mindset. This was a overall helpful gear up session.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things
This gear up was a little bit of a continuation of growth mindset and how to get better at difficult things. One thing that we talked about was breaking up difficult tasks into smaller tasks in order to perfect them. I think that this is a great idea and will be helpful for me. We also talked more about growth mindset, and how keeping a growth mindset can help us do things we never thought we could do.

#### Session 3: Stress Management
This gear up was about action planning and different ways to manage stress. I haven't been too stressed so far, but I still think this was a nice Gear Up. It's a good reminder to use off ramps to manage stress and not take out your stress in a negative way such as anger or isolation.

#### Session 4: Personal Stories and Connections
This gear up was about our values, our world lenses, and how they are used and identified at Turing. I don't feel like I got much out of this gear up because I don't think I really learned anything about myself. I already knew my values and how they drive me.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap
I was sick and missed this one. :(

### Community Participation
I help my peers on homework and projects. I think that I have been an enthusiastic participant in spikes and gear ups. I gave an awesome lightning talk on Epigenetics. I helped to clean the kitchen.
