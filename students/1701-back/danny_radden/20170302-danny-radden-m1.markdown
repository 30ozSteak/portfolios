## D: Professional Development

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](http://example.com) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Mark Van Akkeren):
      Feedback for Mark:
        You were a great partner to work with. I loved the overall flexibility and enthusiasm with working on the project. You had a good grasp on what we had to do and what the assessors were expecting from us. I think we both should have done a better job with TDD. We should have done more TDD from the beginning. Also, you made David Hasselhoff too skinny. You need to work on you ASCII conversion skills. Overall our communication was great between us and i liked your willingness to improve as well.
      Feedback from Mark:
        This went pretty smooth.  It would be interesting to work together again on a harder project, maybe at that point some difficulties or struggles might get sussed out but when the work is well within our current aptitudes there isn't a whole lot of flailing.  I was massively impressed with your familiarity in calling concise methods point by point when modifying data.  I'll take a lot away from that.  When you wanted to refactor my code you took the time to walk me thru it and help me with a better understanding of the process.  There ain't no shit here... because we finished so quickly, and refactored quickly you then were taking the time to help others out.  Only positive vibes.
