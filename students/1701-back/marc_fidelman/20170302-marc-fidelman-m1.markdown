### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Lauren Oliveri): Marc is highly organized, and values planning and pseudocoding before diving in to a large project. That meticulousness and attention to detail before even putting our fingers to the keyboard got us ahead of schedule, even when he got sick Monday and needed to take a day off! Due to the time and effort we spent planning, we were able to think through solutions to challenges days before our peers. Though once we got started coding, Marc struggled with some fundamental ruby concepts and approaches (methods, arguments, hashes, etc.) we discussed in the pseudocode. Continuing to drill himself and practice tons of exercises and fundamentals will help him strengthen his Ruby knowledge. Another strength of Marc’s is that he recognized his limitations and has a strong desire to learn and improve.  When he didn’t understand certain parts of our code, he could have thrown up his hands and said “well it works, but I don’t understand why”. Instead, he made an effort to make sure he could comprehend each portion and explain it. I think because of that, he learned a lot in this project. However, another area of improvement for Marc would be to more quickly and accurately articulate when he doesn’t understand a concept. Sometimes I’d explain a portion of our code multiple times, in different ways, and I’d think he understood, but when we moved to the next part he’d admit that he didn’t. I encourage Marc to more quickly interrupt when he gets lost and try to explain what *he thinks* the code is doing. Marc could practice this with “rubber ducky” coding, meaning pretend you have a little duck and you need to explain to her or him each line of code you’ve written and what it does. An additional strength of Marc’s is his logical approach to problems. Marc has a knack for logically thinking, and when we ran into some tricky errors towards the end of our project (symbols were triggering our capital boolean), he was able to think abstractly about what approaches we could take to circumvent the issue. I appreciated how his electrical engineering background provides him a solid understanding of flow control. Marc should also work on getting more comfortable playing around in irb/pry and running into errors. Often times Marc would get stuck because he wasn’t sure which commands or tools to use for the next step of the project, or he’d start writing a test and get intimidated by the dreaded blank screen. Instead of asking, “what’s the difference between x and y” or “could you use x for this?”, he should either a.) open an irb/pry session and start throwing commands at it, b.) throw in a binding.pry into the code to see what the variables look like, or c.) just start writing code and get an error. I know sometimes I see error messages and immediately know what’s wrong, so I may have taken that practice away from him, but Marc should take the time to carefully read and acquaint himself with error messages. They can be intimidating, but they’re perfectly normal and often really helpful in making the code work! The other motivation behind this feedback is that getting more comfortable with these tools will improve Marc’s ability to figure things out on his own. While I was happy to coach and teach, things don’t stick as well as learning them by oneself through trial and error!

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
Growth Mindset

This is not the first time I've had a teacher holler about "yet". I can't... yet. It's such an important distinction. It's right up there with "all shots not taken are misses". Though it's really nice to have some demonstration of data to backup the common sense in this one. I think that fostering this culture of embracing challenge is really great. I absolutely think if it was better accepted into our mainstream, society would be more healthy.

#### Session 2
Getting Better at Difficult Things

I had a tough time getting on board some of this. Most of it it felt too boiled down to the point of being vague and trite. Though the description of the chick-sexing model and of the process of moving skills from amateur through beginner an into expertise were intesting too. I'm definitely incorporating more exposure into my day.

#### Session 3
Core Values

The Core values definitely an important bonding exercise for the cohort. I think it was another step in opening up to eachother as well as a way to establish cultural goals at Turing. My group definitely veered  off the conversation path with followup questions and depth.

#### Session 4
Personal Stories & Connection

Our group had a lot of overlap with personal stories. I felt there was a running theme of career change and getting to a career position of enough power that we felt like we were able to positively affect society around us. It was also interesting to hear the varied technical background among us.

#### Session 5
Debugging the Gender Gap

I felt this was a pretty important film to watch. Especially in a community where we have these goals of certain demographic representation that aren't really being met. My group was a little disappointed that the film didn't spend more time on gaps of social, economic, and racial disparities even among women.

### Community Participation
This one feels more difficult to quantify. I've been vocal in posse meetings and spikes. I gave my own lightning talk. I tried to help stir LGBTuring into action, though discussion with the group head quickly shifted to the idea that folks are simply not responding in slack and may not have the mental equity to participate more fully.
