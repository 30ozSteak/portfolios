### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Colleen Ward):

Yohanan, thank you for being a great partner on Night Writer. I think overall we worked very well together. Your openness to communicate where you felt your skills were helped me to better understand how we could tackle the project together. Your willingness to be open and honest helped us both to be better partners. You also have a strong skill in turning to testing when we were stuck. I know I don’t always start there, and it was great that you reminded us to go back to try and write a test first. In future group projects I would suggest that you have more confidence in your skills and knowledge and if your partner moves too fast remember to ask questions or take a moment to process what they’ve typed before moving forward. Overall, I think you handled the challenges of this project well and I’m proud of how we worked together!

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1
Growth Mindset

Coming to Turing is a reflection of my belief in a growth mindset. I knew coding would be difficult for me to learn but I believe that effort and practice can lead to desired results when it comes to learning something new that does not initially come easy. Being strategic about my approach to learning, doing small chunks at a time and trying to not get overwhelmed by the large volume of work and constant deadlines will be critical to my success. Embracing instances where I get things wrong as opportunities to learn will also serve me well.

#### Session 2
Getting Better at Difficult Things

A certain degree of struggle and some level of failure is part of the process to getting better at difficult things. While it is difficult to see progress in the initial stages when we are trying to learn something new that does not come easily to us, having a "not yet" mindset can be helpful in allowing us to embrace the process and not focus overly on the outcome that we have yet to achieve. Being non-judgmental towards our learning process and not comparing ourselves to others are also useful in helping us get better at difficult things.

#### Session 3
Core Values

While there are many values that drive me, some of those that stand out for me include that of working for the greater good (public service) and hard work.  

#### Session 4
Personal Stories

I came to Turing because I was interested in a career that would allow me to develop technical skills and help me grow in a personal and professional manner.

#### Session 5
Debugging the Gender Gap

The tech industry has a significant problem when it comes to gender parity. While there are some efforts to address this gap, there is still a lot that needs to be done to ensure that the industry and educational institutions are taking constructive steps to address this significant gap. Turing is mindful of this gap and provides an inclusive environment for people with different backgrounds and identities.

### Community Participation

As a member of the Student Advisory Board, I relayed the concerns of Mod 1 students to Turing staff and participated in weekly advisory board meetings.
