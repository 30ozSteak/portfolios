# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* My primarily goal was to develop a solid understanding of the Ruby language and design principles that govern object-oriented programming. Ideally, by doing this, I would also pass the module. Over the past six weeks, I feel that I have grown and learned a lot. I would consider this growth a success.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* I think I struggled with encapsulation - particularly, I struggled understanding when to use attr_reader and attr_accessor - and hashes. The main takeaways from these struggles were learning how useful the ruby docs are in explaining concepts and how useful my fellow students are to aid in clarfying difficult subjects.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* My favorite project was Night Writer because it was the first opportunity to work with another student. Overall, our group dynamic made the project uniquely rewarding. I think my least favorite was HTTP yeah you know me. I felt like this project was adequately explained in the spec which subsequently meant that a majority of the difficulty in this project was understanding what functionality was expected.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
* Primarily, I learned the importance of asking for help when I was stuck. In HTTP Yeah You Know Me, I felt like I was floundering for awhile trying to understand the spec. By talking with fellow students, my confusion was clarified, and I soon made significant inroads on the project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
* The main lesson I took away from the paired projects is the value of working with another individual. Both Ellen and Megan were great at keeping my code writing honest. They demanded that variables, arguments, methods, and classes were named idiomatically. Additionally, by working with a partner, it became abundantly clear how valuable it is to discussing one's logic as one is coding. This process streamlines working through complex projects. Lastly, it was really fun to see how there are multiple ways of coding the same functionality, and how my partners offered solutions that varied from mine.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

* Health & Wellness 2 was my least favorite because I feel like the models presented were overly simplified. For instance, the tri-uine brain is a very simplistic model of one's nervous system. Although I found the overall takeaway of the importance of sleep and mental health to be enlightening, I think the data used to argue that takeaway was a tad underwhelming.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

* I contributed to the Turing community by participating in the Turing held events, demo night, meditation, and guest speakers. Additionally, I tried to come-in after hours and on weekends, with the explicit purpose of working with other students. This allowed me to start some relationships that I hope continue after Turing.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* I would like to offer my help to other students more and perhaps, offer some coding advice to the incoming cohort. I would also like to attend more lunch meetups, and it would be nice to submit a project to a code-fair.
