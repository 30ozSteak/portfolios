# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* My primarily goal was to develop a solid understanding of the Ruby language and design principles that govern object-oriented programming. Ideally, by doing this, I would also pass the module. Over the past six weeks, I feel that I have grown and learned a lot. I would consider this growth a success.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* I think I struggled with encapsulation - particularly, with regard to attr_reader and attr_accessor - and hashes. The main takeaways from these struggles were learning how useful the ruby docs are in explaining concepts and how useful my fellow students are to aid in clarfying difficult subjects.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
* My favorite project was Night Writer because it was the first opportunity to work with another student. Overall, our group dynamic made the project uniquely rewarding. I think my least favorite was HTTP yeah you know me. I felt like this project was adequately explained in the spec which subsequently meant that a majority of the difficulty in this project was understanding what functionality was expected.
