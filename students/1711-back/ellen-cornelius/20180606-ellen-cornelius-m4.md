### What was your biggest achievement of the module?
For Mod 4, my goals were:
* Demo my capstone. Merge my old world with my new world.
* Write two additional blog posts for my personal website
* Give a lightening talk @Turing Top Talks that I am proud to share on video
* Start becoming “job ready” by practicing code and interviewing questions, networking and applying for jobs
* Win GoCode Colorado

I have achieved all of these (except the last one, but I will find out tonight!)

I'm all about connecting the dots (both in my life and in the Dots game). I set out to do a capstone project that was environmentally health related and ideally working with a client. I reached out to my network of EH colleagues and contacts, and an acquaintance from the Colorado Dept. of Public Health & Environment responded with an awesome oppourtunity to work on a prototype for a real grant they were applying to for food satefy. I jumped at this opportunity and had about 3 meetings with them throughout the mod to figure out exactly what they wanted. I'm really proud of my capstone, and even though I have a lot to still complete, I'm excited at the chance to present the problem and how my app can help the problem at Demo night and thus, connect my old Environmental Health world with software development.

I also wrote two additional blog posts to add to my personal website ellencornelius.com. One was the Part 2 of my ActiveRecord blog post, the other was on PostGIS.

I really worked on my lightening talk before the @Turing Top Talks to get more practice downloading shapefiles and converting them into apps. I have not seent the video yet, but I was proud of the talk I gave and think I will be able to share parts or all of it on my website. 

To get "job-ready," I started practicing Exercisms weekly. I also applied to 6 jobs and through meeting and reaching out to people was able to get them directly to HR. I am currently undergoing one interview process right now with a company. I also have been practicing telling my story and describing my process in working through a project. I have attended three meetups this Mod where I have met a few Ruby developers that I can reach out to and apply to jobs at their companies.

### What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

My biggest struggle was creating a separating front-end app, and connecting it to backend endpoints. It was my first time not using Rails to build a front-end, and so I had to figure out how to use Webpack and NPM/Yarn package managers on my own. I did this by going through Turing's lessons, Googling A LOT, and reaching out to my peers for help. 

### What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?



### How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I think working in the front-end was really interesting and would like to pursue opportunities where I can work full-stack.

### What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
