# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
*I set out to accomplish working on my confidence as a developer and I definitely felt myself becoming more confident in my decisions, debugging, and especially having conversations with peers. I no longer felt like I was the weakest link in my group projects, and I could more easily recognize my strengths and what I brought to the table.
I definitely improved my technical and workflow skills by stalking my peers' GitHub repos and comparing/contrasting their code and PRs to mine. At first I felt like I was being sneaky by doing this... maybe this could be emphasized more in Mod 1 and 2 that this is a really good way to learn. *

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
*I struggled with speed and wanting to learn at my own pace. It was harder to do that this module because expectations were a lot higher and I felt like there were a lot more things to do. I struggled with balancing going at my own learning pace and preventing burn out with trying to get everything done to meet expectations.*

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
*I really liked the Rails Mini Project too because of the choose your own adventure option and freedom to build whatever you wanted within some constraints.*

What did you learn from your independent projects?
*I have to be better about staying disciplined and work harder if I want to get everything done that I set out to do. Follow through is key, I found myself losing some motivation near the end of Job Tracker and Rails Mini :(*

What did you learn from your paired projects?
*In BikeShare I felt like I really improved on my workflow. I also learned a ton about forms, links, rails helpers and dove deeper into the documentation and really solidified my CRUD process.*

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
*I liked the Gear Up where we watched Debugging the Gender Gap and then talked about it. I honestly feel like most of the other Gear ups were not very valuable this Module and think my time could have been better spent doing something else. A lot of them were just watching PPT presentations and not really getting deep into the topics. For example, the one about Networking felt like a mandatory presentation in high school when you've never heard the term networking and someone is explaining the definition to you. Maybe Turing should get Cold Outreach Katie to come in and do a Gear Up about networking and Cold Outreach.*

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
*I started attending Palkha and volunteered to co-lead with Austin. Also go to JCS meetings which I love.*

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
*I would like to be a leader in Palkha - mainly getting Mod 1 and 2 kids to join and have some interesting speaker events. I'm in the process of getting some alums together with Tommasina and having them come in for a panel. I also want to see if there's anything we can do with Code for America... has Turing ever had any relationship with them? I'm also attending some events with Ellen Mary and Joanne over break which I am excited for.*
