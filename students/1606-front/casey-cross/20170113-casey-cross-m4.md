# Casey Cross -  M4 Front End Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for mod 4 were to increase my confidence as a developer and become very comfortable with at least one JavaScript framework (in my case, React).  I also set out to complete one CodeWars challenge per day.  I did not maintain that pace, but I have completed a good number of then, enhancing my vanilla JS skills, specifically in array, string, and object methods.

## Self-Evaluation

### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 3: ~~Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment~~ || **excused from assessment**

### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.

### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

### D: Professional Development

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.
They build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required
activities and does at least one or two above and beyond supports of the community.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I had enough points from the rest of my coursework that I did not need to complete the final assessment.

Evaluation comments: N/A

Evaluation scores: N/A

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

During module 4 we completed four projects: Jet Fuel, Imposter Syndrome, Curiously Native, and our final Capstone Project.

#### Jet Fuel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/jet-fuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)

In this project we built a URL shortener service
that allows users to submit long URLs and creates shortened URLs and auto redirects short URLs to their original address. The app also tracks URL usage and provides popularity statistics.

## Evaluation

### Specification Adherence

* **35 points**: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

* **5 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* **8 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* **10 points** - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

### Workflow

* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Total Score: 88/100

#### Feedback from Jeff Duke

Casey it was great working with you on the capstone project and Jet Fuel.  As we've worked on several projects together there isn't much constructive feedback I can give.  It was great working with you on both projects, we work well together and our git workflow is on point!  It was great working with you throughout the program!

#### Imposter Syndrome

* [First Attempt (abandoned) - GitHub URL](https://github.com/kccrs/recipes)
* [Second Attempt - GitHub URL](https://github.com/mjvalade/electron-recipes)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)

This was an exploration in building a desktop application using Electron. We were free to structure and use any JavaScript framework or library of our choosing.  We chose to use Ember and intended to pull in data from the Spoonacular API.  Due to extensive complications we ended up scrapping the entire project and rebuilding it in two days using jQuery.

This app provides a much needed service to the Turing staff and community. Each Friday at Turing School of Software and Design students host personal interest and extracurricular learning groups called spikes. This app enables any student with a GitHub account to log in to submit a spike proposal to the staff. Staff can then log in and approve spikes and assign them to classroom locations. All students can then log in to self-select the spike they have chosen to attend.

#### Feedback from Jeff Duke

Casey it was great working with you on the capstone project and Jet Fuel.  As we've worked on several projects together there isn't much constructive feedback I can give.  It was great working with you on both projects, we work well together and our git workflow is on point!  It was great working with you throughout the program!

#### Feedback from Pete Springer

The capstone was the first time Casey and I have worked together. This project incorporated the most divide and conquer I have experienced. One thing I noticed that Casey did very well was encouraging us to stay organized with github
issues and code reviews. I also appreciated Casey's willingness and enthusiasm to forge through testing our app.

#### Feedback from Kirsten Swanson

I’m glad I finally got to work with Casey because otherwise I would have been sad if I hadn’t worked with her during my time at Turing. During our capstone project she kept our group very organized and accountable for Github issues, which made our workflow go smoothly. Her motivation to test is inspiring and will definitely benefit her in the future. We had 65 tests! She’s a master at resolving merge conflicts and not at all afraid to encounter them. Together we worked on styling and put together a really polished app. Casey is up for any challenge and ready to tackle whatever aspect of the project needs to be worked on, whether it’s testing, styling, or functionality. It was a pleasure working with Casey!

  * Pitch for personal project/Documentation showing your thought process

  I want to make a create-your-own-adventure story in React using a text-to-speech API and practice using animations and explore designing with SVGs. I wanted to use text to speech to make the site more accessible to kids who haven't yet learned to read, English language learners, and kids with disabilities.
