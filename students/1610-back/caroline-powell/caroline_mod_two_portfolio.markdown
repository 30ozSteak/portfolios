# Carloline Powell - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

**What did you get technically and professionally out of this module? How are you going to use it in the future?**

At the beginning of module 2 we took some time to write down what we wanted to get out of the module personally and professionally and how we wanted to grow as a community member. I wrote this on that day:

* _Technically_: I want to start developing some personal projects. Before we weren't ready, but we're about to be.
* _Personally_: In Mod 1 I had to focus on myself just to get through, but in Mod 2 I want to feel more on top of things so that I can give back and help others more.
* _As a Community Member_: Since my first week at Turing I've been saying that I want to do all these things, but in Mod 2 I want to actually do them instead of just talking about it (e.g. start a posse, visit the TechStars Incubator, get an internet copyright lawyer to come speak on a Friday).

So how did I do on these things?

* _Technical Goal_: I have started developing some personal projects, but they're not as far along as I would like them to be. I'd like to use the intermission break to make some real progress on this.
* _Personal Goal_: I'd say I did a good job. I paired with people and took time to help others through problems when I knew how to solve them. I also led a Friday spike Git and GitHub tutorial for Mod 1 along with Ben Pepper and created an online [repo](https://github.com/CPowell23/github_tutorial) for students to refer to so that they didn't have to go through the gitastrophies that our class experienced in Mod 1.
* _Community Member Goal_: I think I did an awesome job on my community member goal this mod. Amara Lovato and I created the Hamilton posse that will officially start after the break, but we did already start some activities. The github tutorial was a posse endeavor, we set up a field trip for students to attend the local WeWork coworking space, we're sending a large group on a field trip to the Boulder TechStars incubator in March, and I set up an internet copyright lawyer to come speak on a Friday morning. I hope we can keep making this much progress next Mod!

## <a name="self-eval"></a>Self-Evaluated Rubric Scores

Find the rubric near the [end](#rubric) of this document.

* **A: End of Module Assessment** - 4 / Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* **B: Individual & Group Work** - 4 / Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
* **C: Professional Skills** - 4 / Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* **D: Feedback** - 3 / Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* **E: Community Participation** - 4 / Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

* **A: Conceptual Understanding** - 4 / Developer is able to describe concepts with a high degree of specificity and accuracy without assistance
* **B: Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking** - 4 / Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way
* **C: Feature Completeness** - 4 / Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests
* **D: ActiveRecord Syntax and Style** - 3 / Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database
* **E: Rails Style** - 4 / Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and establish logic in the appropriate classes
* **F: Testing** - 4 / Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development independently
* **G: Collaboration** - 4 / Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/mollybrown/bike-share)

* **A: Functional Expectations** - 3.5 / Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* **B: ActiveRecord** - 4 / Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.
* **C: User Experience and Conventions** - 4 / Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.
* **D: Code Organization/Quality** - 4 / Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.
* **E: Testing** - 3 / Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
* **F: Working Collaboratively** - 3 / Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

# <a name="rubric"></a>Portfolio Rubric
[Back to Self-Evaluated Rubric Scores](#self-eval)

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required
activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes
in the feedback they receive. They participate in most required community activities
such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student does not consistently participate in or construct meaningful peer
feedback. They stay in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.

## E: Community Participation
