## End of Module Reflection

**What did you get technically and professionally out of this module? How are you going to use it in the future?**

At the beginning of module 2 we took some time to write down what we wanted to get out of the module personally and professionally and how we wanted to grow as a community member. I wrote this on that day:

* Technically: I want to start developing some personal projects. Before we weren't ready, but we're about to be.
* Personally: In Mod 1 I had to focus on myself just to get through, but in Mod 2 I want to feel more on top of things so that I can give back and help others more.
* As a Community Member: Since my first week at Turing I've been saying that I want to do all these things, but in Mod 2 I want to actually do them instead of just talking about it (e.g. start a posse, visit the TechStars Incubator, get an internet copyright lawyer to come speak on a Friday).

So how did I do on these things?

* Technical Goal: I have started developing some personal projects, but they're not as far along as I would like them to be. I'd like to use the intermission break to make some real progress on this.
* Personal Goal: I'd say I did a good job. I paired with people and took time to help others through problems when I knew how to solve them. I also led a Friday spike Git and GitHub tutorial for Mod 1 along with Ben Pepper and created an online [repo](https://github.com/CPowell23/github_tutorial) for students to refer to so that they didn't have to go through the gitastrophies that our class experienced in Mod 1.
* Community Member Goal: I think I did an awesome job on my community member goal this mod. Amara Lovato and I created the Hamilton posse that will officially start after the break, but we did already start some activities. The github tutorial was a posse endeavor, we set up a field trip for students to attend the local WeWork coworking space, we're sending a large group on a field trip to the Boulder TechStars incubator in March, and I set up an internet copyright lawyer to come speak on a Friday morning. I hope we can keep making this much progress next Mod!

# Portfolio Rubric

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive
positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required
activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes
in the feedback they receive. They participate in most required community activities
such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student does not consistently participate in or construct meaningful peer
feedback. They stay in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.

## E: Community Participation

A Turing student works to build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student stays in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.
