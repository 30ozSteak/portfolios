### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This session focused on bias and how a society of people with even a small amount of bias leads to overall segregation. I have frequently heard the argument that diversity quotas are antithetical to true diversity, but I thought that the Parable of the Polygons game was a clear demonstration that a demand for diversity is the only way to reverse these effects.
