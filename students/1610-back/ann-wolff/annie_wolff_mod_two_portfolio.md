-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.**

### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.**

### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Pinspiration

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/pinspiration)
* [Production Site](https://pinspirations.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island#learning-goals)

Need a new recipe? Maybe some ideas on what to wear to work? What color should you paint your bedroom? Letâ€™s create a platform that allows you to keep all of your inspiration in one place.

##### Completion

**Client Expectations**

*   Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
   *   3.5: As expected, but great

**User Experience**

*   Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
   *   4: Better than expected

**Organization**

*   Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
   *   4: Better than expected

#### Technical Evaluation

**Git Workflow**

*   Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.
   *   3.5: Better than expected
   *   3.5: As expected

**Test Quality**

*   Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?
   *   4: Better than expected

**Code Quality**

*   Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.
   *   3: As expected

**Bonus**

We want to recognize and reward risk-taking and exploration. Sometimes other areas might suffer if the risk doesn't pan out. Earn a bonus point to offset a score above.

*   Did the team push themselves by taking risks?
   *   0: No

### Pivotal Tracker Gem

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/pivotal-tracker/tree/api_version5)

Work on updating Pivotal Tracker Gem to work with v5 of the API. I contributed the readme, the memberships resources endpoint, and a proxy class to allow to gem to mock ActiveRecord's chained methods.

### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/rails_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

rails_engine is an exercise in creating an internal API that serves up business anyltics. It features endpoints that return information on customers, merchants, invoices, invoice items and transactions.

##### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

##### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

**3. API Design**

* 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

**4. Queries**

* 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

This session focused on bias and how a society of people with even a small amount of bias leads to overall segregation. I have frequently heard the argument that diversity quotas are antithetical to true diversity, but I thought that the Parable of the Polygons game was a clear demonstration that a demand for diversity is the only way to reverse these effects. 

#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Automation will continue to take jobs that were previously held by people of all social classes and education. As a country, we're going to be facing social changes that we must address to ensure our future as a united nation. I have been thinking a lot about how I can contribute to limiting the effects of this problem and I haven't come up with a lot of hopeful thoughts yet. I think the most important thing to do is to continue to discuss it and consider it when making decisions about public leader and policy.

#### Univeral Basic Income

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

In thinking about this in the context of the automation talk, I think that UIB is a possible solution, but certainly not a "foregone conclusion" as Elon Musk suggests. It's a new idea that I don't believe much of the nation will embrace right away, but the more we discuss it, the more likely it is to become more popular. I also believe that investing in early childhood education could allow citizens to achieve the higher education levels that are required to obtain the jobs that automation will produce.
