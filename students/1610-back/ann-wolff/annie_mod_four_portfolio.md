## Final Assessment

## Independent Work

#### Quantified Self API

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/quantified-self-api)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self-back-end.md)

This was an extension of the week-one Quantified Self project. We built an API to handle the foods data that we needed for he meal tracker. It's built on Express.js with a Node backend. We also used Knex to connnect to a PostgreSQL database. Lots of new technologies! It was a challenging and exciting extension to the original project and it was cool to learn a new way to build apps without Rails.

## Group Work

#### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DavidKnott/quantified-self)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self)

Built off of a starter kit, Quantified Self was our first exploration of using JavaScript and jQuery to create interactive UI. We learned how to store data without a database and how to wire up buttons and forms to execute user requests. It was tough to jump into a new technology but rewarding to know that we can use what we know to pick up new skills.

##### Specification Adherence

- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**

##### Testing

- **3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.**

##### HTML/UI

- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.**

##### JS syntax and Style

- **2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.**

##### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**

##### Project Management

- **4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.**

##### Risk Taking

Adhering to any of these additional specifications will allow you to increase one score above:

- All functionality is part of a class, written using ES6
- No Libraries (except for testing). All JavaScript functionality is your own.

#### Capstone - Johari Window

* [Front-End GitHub URL](https://github.com/lucyconklin/johari-window)
* [Back-End GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/johari_window_api)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self)

Originally proposed by Lucy, this project was meant to improve Allison's ability to run the Johari Window reflection exercise. We decoupled the front-end and back-end of this project so we ended up with a React app and a Rails API. Making these two technologies work together was a new challenge and taught us a lot about how a front-end team and back-end team could work together. Unfortunately, we were not able to get our React app to play happily with Auth0 for authentication, but I learned a lot about React while wrestling with the problem.
