## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [BikeShare](https://github.com/wlffann/bike-share)

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

##### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

##### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

##### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

##### 5. Testing

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

##### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

#### [Project Name](include-link-to-production-site-here)

If the project was graded, add your evaluation scores and notes. If the project was not graded, add a reflection.

### Individual Projects

#### [MixMaster](https://agile-oasis-92928.herokuapp.com/artists)

We followed a tutorial for this project, which was our first introduction to rails. 

#### [JobTracker](https://wolff-job-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

##### 1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

##### 2) Routes

* 4: Routes are defined for all functionality and not any additional functionality. All routes conform to RESTful conventions for resources, and routes to pages that are not specifically for resources stored in the database are not named in a way that an experienced developer would find surprising.

##### 3) Controllers

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

##### 4) ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

##### 5) Views

* 2.5: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.
* 2.5: Significant logic leaks into the view or remains in controllers and developers show some difficulty in identifying strategies to refactor.

##### 6) User Experience

* 4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

##### 7) Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

#### [TutorialShare](https://tutorial-share.herokuapp.com)

This project was made to fill the requirments of the RailsMini Spec. It is a site inspired by Instructables.com that allows users to create and share craft tutorials and browse other user's projects by category. It features authentication and authorization of users and admins. Users can create and edits projects and onlt view other user's submissions. Only admins can create categories. 

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Grit

Grit is the combination of hard work and passsion. It can often be the determining factor in a person's ability to succeed in a challenging situation and many people are looking for ways to develop grit in themselves and others. Grittiness is an important attribute to develop as a Turing student, and we brainstormed ways to promote this attribute in ourselves. One solution is to look for ways to make our work more meaningful, such as implementing our skills on side projects that we care about and help other students to learn difficult material.

#### Journey Mapping

Journey Mapping is all about considering how someone's background and experience could effect their interaction with a progam or process. By empathizing with the user of a product and attempting to understand how they approach it, developers can improve their process and results. To practice this exercise, our group journey mapped our decision to attend Turing and discovered motovations, pain points and results.

#### MicroAgressions

This Gear Up provoked more conversation amoungst the community than any other I have participated in. Before and after the session, I had discussions on the validity of microagressions, and the difference between impact and intent. I attended the small group session and I found it to be a very sensitive and productive conversation. Between this session and the interactions I had outside of it, I found this to be a very effective idea to introduce into the Turing community.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Collaborative Communication & Agile Project Management

Strong leadership and clarity of purpose is important to the success of an agile project. We discussed ways to encourage these needs in a group setting by encouraging and identifying the stages of development of a team. 

#### Feedback II

#### Finding Oppurtunities

#### Cold Outreach

As strange as it feels to email someone out of the blue, I have had quite a bit of success making new connections with my cold outreach emails. I have scheduled several meetings with people at companies I find very interesting and one of my cohort-mates has already gotten a job interview from her cold-outreach!

#### Networking

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

"Annie was amazing as a group partner in our Bike Share project. I always enjoyed her upbeat attitude in class, and eagerness to bond and become friends as a large class. This attitude was even more apparent in a group of four. She immediately found ways to make everything more exciting. Her planning, preparedness and strong technical toolset was vital to the progress of our project." -- Jesse Shipley

"You bring a huge amount of positive energy to any team that is just very inspiring." -- Laslo Balogh

"Annie was a pleasure to work with. She is both quick-witted and is a quick learner. Annie was a major force and foundation in our team. We wouldnâ€™t have finished the project without her major contributions. I was very appreciative of her walking me through the steps of design, and she took the time to explain things to me when I was having trouble. I really enjoyed working on the final iteration with her, as she made it look so easy when other people were struggling. She was always reminding us to smile even when we felt a bit overworked and tired, and that helped lighten up the atmosphere." -- Marisa Burton

# Portfolio Rubric

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive
positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required
activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes
in the feedback they receive. They participate in most required community activities
such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student does not consistently participate in or construct meaningful peer
feedback. They stay in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.

## E: Community Participation

A Turing student works to build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student stays in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.
