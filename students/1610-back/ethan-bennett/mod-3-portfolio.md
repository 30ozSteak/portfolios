## A: End of Module Assessment Status

Sally said the final grade was technically a fail (I accidentally left the hash from the API call in the view) but, after appealing it, she told me I didn't need to worry about it affecting my portfolio review. So I didn't feel like calling it a "pass" or a "fail" was totally accurate. Maybe a "pail."


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual work this module allowed me to get serious about developing for Ethereum, and the progress has been pretty mind-blowing. Through the course of my self-directed project, I feel like I experienced mod 1 again...but in a totally different type of programming. I definitely feel like, somewhere in the course of this project, I became a "real developer."

#### Lie Ledger

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ethanbennett/lie-ledger)

The first iteration of this project (i.e. the scope of the two week start) implements a proof-of-concept series of smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain. They establish a protocol for crowd-sourced fact checking, complete with cash incentives for contributors and anti-troll safeguards. Being on the blockchain, all contributions will be completely resistent to censorship. Once deployed, this part of the app will act as something like an API, which can communicate through JavaScript to browser extensions or native apps that would notify a reader when they're on a page with registered corrections.

Given the amount of work that could be done on this to really make it work well, I launched it as an open source project. After cleaning it up a little, I'll be registering it as an official Ethereum app and circulating it in the community in order to attract contributors. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I learned just as much from my group projects, but for totally different subjects. It's kind of funny to think that I didn't really know what an API was six weeks ago. I also learned a lot about dealing with difficult team dynamics, but I'll elaborate on that below.

#### Rales Engine

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdconrad89/rails_engine)

I thought I was learning how to build an API, but in retrospect, I retained a lot more of the ActiveRecord practice from this assignment than I did the API building process (I did a good job on that section of the final, but I definitely had to study it). We also made a pretty cringe-worthy mistake with SimpleCov, which resulted in a not-fun shock in our evaluation. The scores below reflect our fixed test portion, which was explicitly allowed but never updated on the official score.

**1. Completion**

* **4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.**
* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.
* 2: Project completes most requirements but fails 7 - 5 (10 to 6 for individual project) spec harness tests.
* 1: Project fails more than 7 (10 for individual project) spec harness tests.

##### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* **3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.** (After fix)
* 2: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%) but does not adequately balance controller and unit tests.
* 1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* **3+: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**
* 2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or application of MVC principles.
* 1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of MVC.

**3. API Design**

* **4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.**
* 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
* 2: Project has inconsistencies or gaps in how its JSON data is organized or formatted.
* 1: Project's API is not fully functional or has significant confusion around request formats.

**4. Queries**

* **4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.**
* 3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.
* 2: Project has some gaps in ActiveRecord usage, including numerous business methods that rely on ruby enumerables to find the appropriate data.
* 1: Project struggles to establish a coherent ActiveRecords schema, including missing relationships or dysfunctional queries.

#### BoxDrop

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ethanbennett/drop-it-like-its-hot)

This project was sort of a train wreck, but we recovered from it well. It culminated in a 4:00 AM final commit, and we all worked well together despite the difficulties. This project emphasized the real value (which we had sort of discounted) of a project manager, and having lost ours early in the project left us with an unclear roadmap and a terrible workflow. Even still, we all did some really cool stuff, and we turned it into a pretty great project considering the circumstances.
