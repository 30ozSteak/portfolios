# Eric Wahlgren-Sauro - M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

What did you get technically and professionally out of this module? How are you going to use it in the future?
I learned how to build, in Ruby on Rails and Sinatra, a fully deployable web application. The process for doing so involves a multitude of steps that I have become proficient with, since starting the module. The greatest value offered from this module is learning how to CRUD out an application. This process involves needing to know how to add content and style a page, create routes, and use a database to store information about our model objects. In the coming module, I plan on using what I've learned about Active Record to help me be successful on Rails-Engine.

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Bike-Share](https://github.com/cews7/bike-share)

[link to notes](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1610-b/2module/bike_share/nick_g_eric_david.md)

#### [Litte-Shop](https://serene-beyond-86450.herokuapp.com/)

If the project was graded, add your evaluation scores and notes. If the project was not graded, add a reflection.

### Individual Projects

#### [Blogger](https://github.com/cews7/blogger)

Blogger was a great introduction to Rails. It let us pick up on how to CRUD an application without making the developer bear of the burden of styling all the pages. It was methodical.

#### [Mix-Master](https://github.com/cews7/mix_master)

Mix-Master seemed like a slight extension on Blogger. I can't remember how it differed which I think comes as a result of working all the time in a Rails environment. 

#### [Job-Tracker](https://hidden-forest-51950.herokuapp.com/)

Overall, good work with this. be sure to test all the methods your write and test sad paths. let me know if you have questions on my comments. 

**Database, Relationships, and Migrations**
* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

**Routes**
* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

**Controllers**
* 3: Significant logic exists in the controllers. Methods may be more complicated than necessary. Most functionality is still supported.

**ActiveRecord**
* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

**Views**
* 2: Significant logic leaks into the view or remains in controllers and developers show some difficulty in identifying strategies to refactor.

**User Experience**
* 3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.

**Testing**
* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Micro-Agressions

This was pretty heated, as I recall. I was in a group with Daniel, Jesse, and Drew. We arrived at consensus that if micro-agressions represent of cutting edge of intolerant behavior, then we are making good progress as a society. With that said, I recall being a bit annoyed that this neo-liberal agenda was being pushed on me. Freedom of speech is in jeopardy when we start to make safe-spaces. I'm continually making efforts to run the latest moral reasoning software on my wet-ware. 

#### Journey Mapping

Wasn't in attendance. 

#### Grit

I really appreciated being with my co-hort for this session, as it allowed for strong emotions to come through that otherwise might have not. I was grouped with Ethan and Amy during the questions portion. Both expressed strong emotions towards the subject, saying that the TED Talk's explanation of grit came across as being passion. These concepts were argued to be very distinct ideas and that grit was being hijacked. Paraphrased, we agreed that grit is dealing with a situation in which we could have given up due to difficulty, but opted not to. 

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Agile Practices & Project Management

For Bike-Share we didn't take advantage of agile practices nearly as much compared to Little-Shop. For Bike-Share we worked almost exclusively face-to-face, which had merit, but didn't make us nearly as efficient as if we had worked independently more often. In Little-Shop, our team worked remotely more often than not. Our communication mostly took place over Slack, and Google Hangout. For more complicated work, we parked at TVs together during our work-time during the week days at Turing.

#### Cold Outreach

Cold outreach isn't nearly as scary as it seems initially. The hardest part is tracking down emails. I used a Chrome plug-in and Excel email generator to track down the emails for people I found on LinkedIn. I reached out to SendGrid, GoSpotCheck, PivotalLabs, Twitter, AspenWare, Gusto, and CaptainU. I heard back from the director of engineering at the Boulder office for Twitter; made contact with a developer from SendGrid; made contact with a developer from GSC; made contact with a developer from Gusto. I have meetings set up with someone from each of these companies. 

#### Feedback II



## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

**Marisa Burton**
*Marisa carried a can-do-attitude on every step of Little-Shop. We often would pair together over screenhero and be equally lost in what to do next and right when I would be tempted to justify taking a break, she'd perk up with an idea on how to solve the current issue. She is smart, but often unsure of herself. While this isn't untrue of many Turing students, she sometimes comes across as being too hard on herself at times. She frequently verbally represented, how I was feeling on the inside as we worked through problems together. She's a hard worker and a fun teammate. She loves George Michael!*

**Jason Conrad**
*Jason is the undisputed pop-culture guru of the co-hort. His light-hearted approach to our work, married with intense desire to push forward struck the perfect balance on Little-Shop. When doing our DTR as a group, and struggling to come up with an idea for the store, Jason perked up with the idea of doing all things mini for our Little-Shop project. Once he gets excited about something, he's off to the races. He scrolled through six pages of Google results to find a perfect video on setting up a cart for our project. He seeded all the data and had fun doing it.*

**David Knott**
*I worked on Bike-Share with David. Whenever I'm around him, I feel he's about to explode with energy. His intensity is a great asset to any team. He loves his work and it shows. He's a bottomless well of idea for how to solve an issue. A de-bugging machine, really. At moments, I felt out of the loop on his thought process and subsequently lost my bearings.*

**Molly Brown**
*I'll keep this concise because Molly would want that. Molly's diligence was the glue of our little-shop team. Whenever we'd be off task as a collective, she'd be quick to bring our attention back to the demands of the project. I appreciated her ability to stay focused. She also was able to make meaningful progress, working independently.*

**Mike Schutte**
*Endowed with a deep fascination regarding the process of programming, Mike raises my expectations for test coverage and well refactored code. Beyond programming, he is among my favorite people at Turing. Ten minutes of conversation always leaves me with new considerations to reflect on. He is a fully-developed human with a capacity for seeing multiple layers of need coming from people, simultaneously. Consequently, Mike is highly flexible in his approach and always strives to achieve a well presented outcome.*

### Being a Community Member

**Nick Isaacs (mentor)**


**Mike Schutte**
*A wise woman once told me that the smartest person in the room doesn’t have all the answers, they just ask the right questions. Eric is a phenomenally present and curious listener in all situations, and delivers questions at will that reflect this unrivaled sense of intention. In the hustle bustle lifestyle of Turing, Eric is a continual breath of fresh and authentic air that always reminds me to think beyond the scope of a single project or problem, and remember why this work matters and how satisfying it can be. He demonstrates respect and empathy in a multitude of ways, and I am sincerely grateful for his presence during my Turing experience.*

**Marisa Burton**
*I really enjoyed working with Eric on Little Shop. He perseveres and is great to pair with and work through a problem together. Eric is always focused on completing a task until it’s completed, and he knows when to ask for help when he needs it. Eric knows a lot more than he thinks he does, and I hope he will be more confident with coding in the future.*

## E: Community Participation

I paired with module one students frequently, attended Friday speakers, and helped lead a spike session on Machine Learning APIs.
