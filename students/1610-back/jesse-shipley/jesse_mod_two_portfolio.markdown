## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Gryff Outdoor](https://github.com/riverswb/gryff_outdoor)
scores here

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/Sh1pley/bike-share)

1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

5. Testing

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

6. Working Collaboratively

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

### Individual Projects

#### [Job Tracker](https://github.com/Sh1pley/job-tracker)

1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

* 4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

2) Routes

* 3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

3) Controllers

* 3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

4) ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

5) Views

* 2.5: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

* 2.5: Significant logic leaks into the view or remains in controllers and developers show some difficulty in identifying strategies to refactor.

6) User Experience

* 4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

7) Testing

* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions
The topic was not a bad one. Especially in an environment with so many varied backgrounds. In the group I was in, of the 4 of us, none of us had the same or even similar backgrounds and upbringings. Which I believe really drove home the point that a microaggression can be vastly translated into many different and conflicting things. 

I think the moral of the Gear Up (to me), was that we are all people and have feelings. The best way to possibly mitigate microaggressions is to openly communicate and try harder to not assume worst intent. Everyone has a person battle they are going through and interactions can sway in various ways depending on this.

#### Journey Mapping
This gear up was a little different, in the way that it touched on both mental wellness and maintenance and also could direct a design choice in the way that your thinking the user should interact with a product. 

I liked that framing your personal experiences varies with the ability to cope or deal with the stressors involved. This seems like a good topic to bring up when a stressful situation arises. It could help to take a step back out of the thick of the situation and try to frame it into something more explanable.

#### Grit
I think this topic really sums up most students in any category and school. The grit of a person becomes a driving reason to push forward and complete. It seems like everyone has a different reason and alternatively different 'excuses' that allow stress to invade and tamper with that purpose.

I like the topics of grit and resilience. The thoughts that everyone is fighting for something and fighting something really helps you understand a person. The attitudes, drive, and behavior all seem to make sense when your able to actually think about what a day in the life is for that person. 

Also at this point in Turing, I feel that the tools are all available to us now. Some more practiced than others, but none the less the tool box is fully open to a degree. I really find joy in diving into the capabilities in tech and to try and wrap my mind around what is possible in the future has become a sort of driving amitibion for me.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding New Opportunities
This session was very infomative. I think the tracking times and topics of when you contacted a job prospect is very smart. It seems to also be a way to allow me to hone in on what I actually want in a tech job, while at the same time keeping things realistic.

#### Agile Practices & Project Management && Collaborative Communication
This topic really solidified alot of information with me, as well as a lot of my person behavior. I had the pleasure and displeasure to work with a large variety of people. All of which had vastly changing ways of 'leading'. I have also had the opportunity to lead others in many different environments. 

The articles provided were very very good reads, and I will continue to think of my team above my self in future opportunities to lead. I once had a Commander, Brigadier General Samuel Mahaney. Who always led and closed with his token saying; 'Take care of the people, and they will take care of the mission.' This continues to prove to be effective leadership in my eyes, and those of others as the articles and content of Allison's lesson would go on to teach.

#### Feedback II
I learned that one of my greatest strengths is also my biggest weakness. I have a very even keeled personality. I do not show much effects from stress and remain calm under pressure. Which is a great strength, I am able to keep peace and steer difficult tasks and topics without over reacting or getting bogged down. I lean on this heavily as it is a peaceful way for me to tackle tasks and problems. 

However, I learned the negative effect of this as well. As did my fellow team mates on the Bike Share project. I allowed myself to fall into a pretty big rabbit hole navigating a particular problem during the project. And because I perceived the groups attitude as already stressed I didn't want to add any more fuel to the fire, so I pushed on. 

Had I stopped to ask questions early on, the problem would have been fixed in the same 15 mins it took to clarify the issue with my team mates and I could have moved on to a new task to push development. This was an important lesson, and one I will carry forward with me. I now like to ask early questions/see examples of something I am maybe 'fuzzy' on. So that I can be of more use to my team.

#### Cold Outreach
This was an interesting topic and concept to the class as a whole I felt. I do like the idea of putting a friendly email out to show interest and to broaden your connections in a world that seems to be so very connected. I have been making it a point to attend all guest speakers and to add each one to my LinkedIn as well. To be able to lean on the experience here at Turing and connect on the subjcts of topics brought to us that I feel are interesting and engaging.

I have reached out to contacts at companies like: HyprLoco, CaptainU, Granikis, and the City of Ft. Collins.

# Portfolio Rubric

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive
positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required
activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes
in the feedback they receive. They participate in most required community activities
such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student does not consistently participate in or construct meaningful peer
feedback. They stay in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.

## E: Community Participation

A Turing student works to build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student stays in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.
