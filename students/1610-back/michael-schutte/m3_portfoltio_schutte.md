# Mike Schutte - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Feeling comfortable with my skills with the Ruby language and the Rails framework, I look forward to learning about other technologies/languages/frameworks on my own.
As a developer, I will reflect on what my unique strengths are, and how I can leverage that to further improve my craft, as well as communicated to others how I can add value to a project or team.
I will also keep networking and opportunity-finding top of mind and front-loaded in order to facilitate a less stressful Mod 4 finish.

Feedback for Schutte (From Drew Palazzari):

Positives: Schutte is an excellent coder. He is highly intelligent and very professional. Schutte is a pleasure to pair with and does a good job  in paired programming. Schutte bring s a lot to the table when working with him on a project. His testing is phenomenal and very thorough.

Constructive: Sometimes Schutte can get in the programming zone and not be as open minded to practical solutions. I too am guilty of this, but it is something to keep in mind at all times when pair-programming.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Drew Palazzari: Working with you was both highly productive, and highly enjoyable. I respect and appreciate your commitment to quality code through as much paired programming as possible. You are endlessly witty, and exude a positive attitude at all times even in the face of a massive work load.
For future improvement, I recommend gaining more command of your work flow tools, especially the text editor. Itâ€™s a minor thing, but there were a couple times where you made moves to implement an idea, and a laggy mouse drag or selection caused you to forget what your original goal was.
I am incredibly proud of our project, and I firmly believe it was taken to the next level by your fastidious code reviews and high quality Ruby style. Best of luck on future projects!
