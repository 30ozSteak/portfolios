# Mike Schutte - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Feeling comfortable with my skills with the Ruby language and the Rails framework, I look forward to learning about other technologies/languages/frameworks on my own.
As a developer, I will reflect on what my unique strengths are, and how I can leverage that to further improve my craft, as well as communicated to others how I can add value to a project or team.
I will also keep networking and opportunity-finding top of mind and front-loaded in order to facilitate a less stressful Mod 4 finish.

Feedback for Schutte (From Drew Palazzari):

Positives: Schutte is an excellent coder. He is highly intelligent and very professional. Schutte is a pleasure to pair with and does a good job  in paired programming. Schutte bring s a lot to the table when working with him on a project. His testing is phenomenal and very thorough.

Constructive: Sometimes Schutte can get in the programming zone and not be as open minded to practical solutions. I too am guilty of this, but it is something to keep in mind at all times when pair-programming.

#### Pivotal Tracker Gem (Apicurious)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonnoble/pivotal-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

Lucy Conklin, Kyle Heppenstall, Annie Wolff, and I got the chance to contribute to a gem that wraps queries to the Pivotal Tracker API in Ruby methods.
While we did not spend as much time hitting API's as I'm sure everyone else in the cohort did for Apicurious, I am very pleased with how much I learned about constructing a gem and more advanced Git workflow.

####  [PadCrach](http://padcrash.herokuapp.com/) (Airbnb Cloney Island)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/air_bnb_clone)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)

With five people at hand, we set out to recreate some of the functionality of Airbnb.

In PadCrash you can:
* Create a user account
* Search and reserve available pads
* Chat with host about each reservation
* Upload your own pad to rent out for travelers

Features we're proud of:
* Used Travis CI for continuous integration
* 2-factor authentication via Twilio
* Geocoder used to integrate couch locations for display on Google Maps (COMING SOON!)
* Upload photos of your pad with Carrierwave
* Use of AJAX to update available pad Search
* CSS: flexboxes on flexboxes

Feedback:

From Nick Gheorghita: Mr. Schutte! It was a pleasure finally working on a project together. Can’t say enough about how great you are as a team member, and your skills as a coder. But, I’ll try. Even though we dumped the responsibility of PM on you, you took it on and murdered it with ease. The fact that our project came together while we were all working on separate features comes down largely to how well you did this job. I’m in constant awe of your refactoring skills, it’s something that’s gonna take you far in your career. Your people skills are also on point. Always with the high and positive energy, even when we’re bogged down in the muddy trenches, under constant siege from ugly and boring stories, you pop in like a whiff of fresh air on a dewy, spring morning.

From Jesse Shipley: Finally got to work with you during an 'official' project! I always envied the way you could immerse yourself
into your work and still come away with such a refreshing outlook on the concepts and application. I know we
'voluntold' the project manager position to you, but your work ethic, drive and passion really matched that job well.
I think one thing you could work on in is using your drive and passion to really push the boundaries of a group
project. Whether you are in charge of development decisions or just a part of them. You have an immense value in
group cohesion and it sometimes led down a path of no resolve when multiple ideas were brought up. I really
appreciate the way you value a group mindset but sometimes a set path builds a more creative idea.
I wanted to also thank you again for all of the time and effort you put in to make this an amazing group experience!
You dedicated hours of work into our user stories, and dissected Josh's thoughts on possible pathways in our project.
All of this work went so far to help our progress and allow us that extra time in the end to truly branch out and learn
new concepts. I am completely confident in saying that without that extra, sometimes unseen, effort we would not have
had such an awesome time with the last push in this project.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Firstly, the [Parable of the Polygons](http://ncase.me/polygons/) software was an amazing application of dense academic work on top of really beautiful software.
I think it was a great way to prime us of a more open and productive discussion on what can be a sensitive topic. No one wants to be labeled
as a racist or sexist or whatever insert-stigmatized-label-here-ist, so I appreciate how this approach to anti-bias is made up of partially
accepting and normalizing our inherent biases, and also recognizing that we have the power to be aware of, and ultimately change, these biases.
I also love paradigms that are action oriented in a positive way, as opposed to negative. Put differently, asking people to do something instead of asking people to not do something.
Giving people an actionable thing to try, such as seeking to engage with more diverse people, is a fundamentally different ask than
'Hey, stop being racist.' Moving forward, I will not consider whether someone or an organization is open-minded or not, but whether they actively seek out different schools of thought and practice.

#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

This was a very sobering topic to engage with. In a relatively short amount of time, humans have decidedly figured out how to survive.
Accordingly, work needs a fundamental change in perspective. We don't have to figure out how to live anymore, we need to figure out how to live a life worth living.
Perhaps complete automation will eventually allow people to stop freaking out about material gain. Then we can learn how to be mindful and still and then maybe actually transcend or progress as a species.
We might have fancy gadgets, but our behavior in the most abstract sense is no different than any other species.

I am very happy this was a gear up session. Nate did a great job emphasizing that this consideration is essential for us to keep top of mind as we advance in our careers.

#### Universal Basic Income

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Drew Palazzari: Working with you was both highly productive, and highly enjoyable. I respect and appreciate your commitment to quality code through as much paired programming as possible. You are endlessly witty, and exude a positive attitude at all times even in the face of a massive work load.
For future improvement, I recommend gaining more command of your work flow tools, especially the text editor. It’s a minor thing, but there were a couple times where you made moves to implement an idea, and a laggy mouse drag or selection caused you to forget what your original goal was.
I am incredibly proud of our project, and I firmly believe it was taken to the next level by your fastidious code reviews and high quality Ruby style. Best of luck on future projects!

To Lucy Conklin: Lucy is an absolute positive influence on our cohort. She brings an air of maturity, respect, and excitement like no one else. She contributes considerably to the overall mood of our cohort, which is generally congenial and supportive. This all comes along with her top notch technical skills. She is a thorough problem solver, and innovative thinker. I am happy for anyone who gets to work with her in the future.

To Jesse Shipley: I have immense respect for how many "life things" you juggle with Turing. Along with all of your commitments, you retain an awesome sense of passion and curiosity for programming, which makes you an ideal team member for figuring out new technologies (like Geocoder). For improvement, I think you could work on troubleshooting more independently instead of relying solely on documentation. While the latter approach is essential sometimes, I think a thorough reading of the stack trace could save you time and strengthen your understanding of the code. Thank you for being such a great teammate, and for all your intrepid contributions to our project's functionality. Good luck on your future work!

To Nick Erhardt: I'm glad we finally got to work together, especially on such a large project. As a programmer, you have impeccable style and attention to detail. As a teammate, you are helpful, patient, and productive. For future improvement, I recommend you bring more awareness of your former role as a program manager to your more peer-to-peer interactions. When you offer feedback or guidance, it often comes across more as a command than an instruction. I'm confident this isn't your intent, but a perception that might be worth noting. Overall, thank you for your quality contributions, both technical and interpersonal, to the project, and good luck on future work.

To Nick Gheorghita: My main hacker! Nick, you are a fundamentally fun person to be around. Somehow, you strike a great balance between a focused and a happy-go-lucky attitude. Technically, I am incredibly impressed by your ability to solve almost any bug or problem. One downside to this, in my opinion, can be sloppy or cryptic code that is hard to read and build off. Overall, thank you for your outstanding contributions (esp. AJAX and GoogleMaps) that took the project to the next level. Good luck on your future work!

To Brett Rivers: I think all teammates would be better off if they were as self-aware as you. At the beginning of the project, you articulated very clearly what your preferences and skills were, which made for a great team workflow down the road. Thank you for busting your tail on a lot of database work, and the Twilio integration. My only suggestion for future improvement is to consider more DRY solutions to your code. For example, accessing associated attributes through objects that are already defined (like current_user). Overall, I'm really grateful for all your work on this project, and I wish you luck on your future work!

### Being a Community Member

From Kenia Farias: I think today's spike was super helpful. I was able to successfully set up a bullet journal and I'm really excited to get more organized. I think this is a great way for Turing students to organize their day to day work/lives wich really helps with time management. Thanks for taking the time to go through the bullet journal!

From Staci Williams: Great Spike today Mike! I am really excited to use my new journal and stop trying to use ten different things to stay organized. Thank you for taking the time to give a spike and give us some of your knowledge. Much appreciated!

From Gabi Procell: I have the worst time with finding effective methods to organize my schedule. Thank you, Schutte, for presenting a Spike session on Bullet Journaling. I felt that this is a productivity method that I will be able to maintain, and it was even easier to get started by having someone guide me through the concept.

From Ken Lee: Hey Mike, thanks for the Time Management/Bullet Journal spike today. I will try out this new technique to keep up the positive feedback from checking off things on my list.
