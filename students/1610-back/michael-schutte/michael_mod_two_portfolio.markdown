# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

Personally, I want to become a better collaborator by being less attached to my own work and stylistic preferences. 
On a technical level, I want to develop a deep understanding of database architecture, Rails,
and what's going on in the black boxes of the internet and web applications.
As a community member, I want to take a leadership role in holding extra-curricular space for Ruby drills and content reviews.

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

#### [Bike Share]((https://github.com/mollybrown/bike-share)

Bike Share is an application used for tracking analytics of a San Francisco bike sharing system.
Using open source data from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share), 
we constructed a relational database using SQL that includes tables for trips, stations,
and weather conditions by date. Using this database, we created methods to calculate
trends in the data about bike usage relative to stations and weather.
To display this application, we used the Sinatra framework and Bootstrap styling
for our HTML views. Each major table (stations, trips, and weather) exhibits full
CRUD functionality.

Working along with Ethan Bennett, Molly Brown, and Caroline Powell, my focus was
particularly on our test driven development and analytics methods.

## Evaluation Rubric

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 4: Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.

### 5. Testing

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

I missed the in-person component of this Gear Up due to medical reasons, but I read the articles for "Responding to Microaggressions" and was deeply affected by them.
With a background in sociology, the concept is not unfamiliar to me, but it was refreshing to consider it in a more applied context, outside of academia.
Demographically and in terms of identity, I benefit massively and unfairly from the massive institutions of gender, race, sexuality, and so on. In other words, as
a straight, white, middle-class male, I can't say I've ever truly been the recipient of a microaggression. For a few years of my life, I felt very guilty for this,
but I've come to accept that guilt does not change anything, and just as demographics and identities that fall outside of US hegemony did not choose their lives,
so too was my lot in life relatively random and out of my control. So instead of guilt, I respond to realities such as microaggression with a commitment to pay
attention to the actions and behaviors of others, and, more importantly, to speak up and act when people abuse others with their words.
  
I recently saw an interview with Jon Stewart in which he said the idea of the U.S. is fundamentally difficult, in that it's never been done before. This idea 
of equality and open-mindedness is not our default setting. It would be easy to default to tribalistic instincts and stereotype others unlike ourselves,
but I take comfort in the idea of trying to transcend that impulse in order to achieve a greater sense of what it means to be a human on this earth, and not just
from a particular and narrow slice of experience.

#### Session Name

Write 3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Collaborative Communication

Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didnâ€™t go well?
How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process

1. Project: Bike Share
    * With the spec designed in a more agile structure to begin with (i.e., small iterations of completion building on top of each other),
    our team stuck with this approach. To distribute tasks, we used a Waffle board and a Google Sheets task list, the latter ended up being more 
    clear for us as a group. To facilitate regular communication, we closed each work session with a rose-bud-thorn reflection, where we each shared what 
    we thought went well (rose), what we thought could be improved (thorn), and what we looked forward to (bud). Additionally, we developed a good culture of 
    frequent check-in polls (e.g., "How's everybody feeling in terms of where we are at in the project right now?") at times of task change/transition.
    We also used Slack to update each other on new developments while we worked remotely.
        
      After retro-ing our project, our group unanimously agreed that we learned a lot about how to manage a four-person project. Originally, we tried to split
    up the CRUD functionality in four groups, one per person, and quickly realized that the interconnected nature of CRUD made this to be more of a hassle
    than a gain in efficiency. It would have been more efficient to do the CRUD all together, or have one person do it, then distribute tasks (such as the analytics methods
    and styling) from there. Conflict wise, our main "storming" moment occurred due to one group member and I drawing out a database schema on our own
    without updating the other two group members. This caused them to feel both out of the loop and as if they were slacking. Fortunately, one of them brought it
    up immediately, and the two of us recognized how our actions could cause those feelings of anxiety and frustration, and we swiftly moved into a stage of 
    "norming". On the positive side, we were all very happy with how clear our communication and Github workflow was.

2. Project: Little Shop
    * 

3. Incorporating Feedback
    * After Bike Share, the main feedback themes I received were 1) that I have a great attitude and really help with the groups energy, and 2) that when I 
    get on a roll with my code, I can forget to explain to the group what I'm working on or how I'm doing it. They all said that I eventually clarified this each time,
    but that I could improve by doing so sooner. 
    * In the context of being a teammate, I learned that I have an unique ability to influence the group's energy. I've never been super drawn to 
    deciding in which direction the group should go, but I do feel like a leader in being able to make sure we have the energy and capacity to get where we're going.
    In this way, I feel a bit like a team battery: my job is to keep us charged up so we can do the work we set out to do, and do it in high spirits. I'm grateful for 
    learning this about myself, and I'm excited to keep this framework top of mind as I move on to new projects with different teams.

#### Finding Opportunities
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://trello.com/b/GrDk8PVl/job-tracker-mike-schutte)

With all the anxiety associated with the job hunt, I appreciated how grounded this session was. It consisted entirely of *how* to actually find connections and opportunities.
My biggest takeaway from this session is to not be intimidated or disappointed if a company does not have job listings in my area. If that is the case,
I can reach out to someone anyway and just see what it's like to work there, and develop a relationship from an informational standpoint. 
Moreover, it was exciting to put together a job tracker and remember that the whole reason I'm at Turing is to find a fulfilling career as a software developer.

## E: Community Participation

How did you actively contribute to the Turing community?

 * Drills for Skills: I started up an extracurricular space for people to work on and polish their Ruby programming skills. 
  These sessions centered around Ruby Exercisms, where we worked independently for ten minutus, collaboratively for another ten, and finally reviewed
  challanges and new content for five.

  * Pahlka Posse: We focused this mod on a project that visualizes important education data
  to make schooling information accessible to more people. I played a key role in parsing PDF tables, desisgning the relational database,
  and seeding this data into a Rails application.

# Portfolio Rubric

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive
positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required
activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes
in the feedback they receive. They participate in most required community activities
such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student does not consistently participate in or construct meaningful peer
feedback. They stay in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.

## E: Community Participation

A Turing student works to build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
