# Erin Pintozzi - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had a primary goal with the overarching goal of passing Module 4 in preparation for a career as a software developer:

#### Goal - Be a “Yes (Wo)man”
Continuation of Mod 1, 2, & 3 goal: The purpose of this goal is to encourage myself to do things outside of my comfort zone that I might normally say “no” to doing. This goal will help me be a better student, peer, and person both in and out of the classroom. This goal strongly ties in with the Community graduation requirement as well, and there was quite a bit of overlap. I will strive do at least 1 thing outside of my comfort zone each week such as attending a meetup, giving a talk, joining a group, or similar. If 1 opportunity is not available, I will introduce myself to at least one new person or write a blog post as a substitute event.

##### Result
I maintained a google doc to track the new things I tried and participated in to reach this goal:
* Volunteer as a prework guide
* Led a Friday Spike on Project Management
* Co-led a workshop for the Women in STEM series
* Joined the "Pairing" channel to find new opportunities to help "younger" mods be successful at Turing
* Blog/document my personal project process (in progress)
*

## D: Professional Skills
The professional skills sessions are an integral part of our Turing program because we are learning skills that are very industry specific for our soon-to-be new careers. This includes both examining how we are presenting ourselves to those on the outside as well as personal reflections to make sure we are striving to be the best versions of ourselves.
