# Erin Pintozzi - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had a primary goal with the overarching goal of passing Module 4 in preparation for a career as a software developer:

#### Goal - Be a “Yes (Wo)man”
Continuation of Mod 1, 2, & 3 goal: The purpose of this goal is to encourage myself to do things outside of my comfort zone that I might normally say “no” to doing. This goal will help me be a better student, peer, and person both in and out of the classroom. This goal strongly ties in with the Community graduation requirement as well, and there was quite a bit of overlap. I will strive do at least 1 thing outside of my comfort zone each week such as attending a meetup, giving a talk, joining a group, or similar. If 1 opportunity is not available, I will introduce myself to at least one new person or write a blog post as a substitute event.

##### Result
I maintained a google doc to track the new things I tried and participated in to reach this goal:
* Volunteer as a pre-work guide
* Led a Friday Spike on Project Management
* Co-led a workshop for the Women in STEM series
* Joined the "Pairing" channel to find new opportunities to help "younger" mods be successful at Turing (and then paired with People)
* Blog/document my personal project process (in progress)
*

Notes:

* Tracker indicates all expected features are delivered
* user experience is pretty solid
* Day navigation and persistence works
* Log stays accurate with changes, edits, deletions
* Testing looks really good
* Look out for little things like target/verify based on CSS classes rather than specific values
* Experiment with dynamic ID generation in your view rendering to allow for targeting on identity rather than hierarchy (nth-child)
* JavaScript implementation style is beautiful
* Good job isolating the ugly/unpleasant parts and keeping them away from the good stuff

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

### Testing

- 4: All functionality is covered by tests. Tests can be run both in the browser and terminal. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests

### HTML/CSS/UI

- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

### JS syntax and Style

- 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate

### Git Workflow

- 4: Team uses Uses master for production, develop as the current state of development and feature branches for individual work. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation

### Project Management

- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

#### Ripped/Code of Arms

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/ripped)


Code of Arms is an Exercism-like application for the Turing School of Software and Design to help students practice coding and instructors give feedback in a streamlined manner.

## D: Professional Skills
The professional skills sessions are an integral part of our Turing program because we are learning skills that are very industry specific for our soon-to-be new careers. This includes both examining how we are presenting ourselves to those on the outside as well as personal reflections to make sure we are striving to be the best versions of ourselves.

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

My biggest takeaway from this session was the idea that we define "likeness" wrong. 100% (or close to it) of people at Turing are "like me" because we all quit our jobs to come learn to code. We all like solving problems. I don't think "like me" is as one dimensional as gender or skin tone. That said I realize that things like gender, race, orientation are the types of things that tend to lead toward this type of segregation. I think a lot of that is based in ignorance and fear. If we all tried to find "like" things in each other, I bet we'd be surprised.

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

My big takeaway from this session was thinking about what automation means for me, my peers, and my neighbors (aka "the world"). It reminds me of the book _Player Piano_ by Vonnegut. The hardest question to answer, to me, isn't about income, it's "what happens when there's nothing I can do to contribute to society?" One of the biggest reasons I came to Turing is that I wanted a better challenge in my career and for myself and my growth. If there isn't a job for me or anyone, what do we do? How do we stay challenged and remain interested in anything? Money is the least of my worries. What a horrible boring life to have no purpose.

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

I had some fairly inconclusive takeaways from this session. I don't think it's a novel idea. It's just another variation of welfare (which I do think is necessary and generally good). I think another solution, and probably better one, is figuring out how to provide "necessities" for less: healthcare, housing, and food. And frankly, I don't think it's a one or the other. Why not try and marry both of those ideas together? Once topic that came up was the "freeloading" of people who won't work because they don't have to. I think that misses the point. I think everyone should have a right to basic necessities. My taxes are what they are because I had the privilege and opportunity to go to school and get a job that I like. Taxes are necessary for many things, including helping our neighbors, and I don't feel bad about that.

#### Strengthsfinder session

Vision Statement: In the next year, I will pursue my career goal of moving out of a junior role in to a non-junior role and begin/continue preparing myself for a team lead position in the future. By using my deliberative and discipline strengths,  I will channel my energy in to finding opportunities, avoiding pitfalls, and learning continuously.

How I'll achieve this: 	
* Practice being comfortable in my shoes. I feel like I'm growing out of my imposter syndrome here but I'm not confident that that'll stick with me in to the job, especially in a field where it seems women kind of get the short end of the stick sometimes. If I want to make it to a team lead position I will need to practice being a leader, having opinions and healthy disagreements in addition to just making valuable code contributions.
* To get there I can:
	* Cold outreach
	* Give lightening talks or a talk at a meetup
	* Go to meetups and just get to know people; I don't think my "practice" has to be limited to my work team
		§ This will also help me learn about new potential opportunities in case a shift to team lead doesn't exist at my first company
	* Write a blog or anything that helps me feel confident and authoritative on a technical subject
	* I would like to support my cohort-mates however they need it. Everyone is different so what sounds like good support to me may not be the same for someone else.
		* I would love to someday be the person that introduces someone to their new awesome job because of the network I've been able to build
