# Erin Pintozzi - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had a primary goal with the overarching goal of passing Module 4 in preparation for a career as a software developer:

#### Goal - Be a “Yes (Wo)man”
Continuation of Mod 1, 2, & 3 goal: The purpose of this goal is to encourage myself to do things outside of my comfort zone that I might normally say “no” to doing. This goal will help me be a better student, peer, and person both in and out of the classroom. This goal strongly ties in with the Community graduation requirement as well, and there was quite a bit of overlap. I will strive do at least 1 thing outside of my comfort zone each week such as attending a meetup, giving a talk, joining a group, or similar. If 1 opportunity is not available, I will introduce myself to at least one new person or write a blog post as a substitute event.

##### Result
I maintained a google doc to track the new things I tried and participated in to reach this goal:
* Volunteer as a prework guide
* Led a Friday Spike on Project Management
* Co-led a workshop for the Women in STEM series
* Joined the "Pairing" channel to find new opportunities to help "younger" mods be successful at Turing
* Blog/document my personal project process (in progress)
