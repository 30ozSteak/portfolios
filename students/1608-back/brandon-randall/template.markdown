### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

I set out to learn the basics of programming and how to how to use collections, iterations and syntax.

### End of Module Assessment

****Final Assessment****
### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

### 2. Ruby Style
* 3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

### 3. Blocks & Enumerations
* 2: Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks

### 4. Testing
* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

### 5. Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### 6. Collaboration
* 2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops

Notes:

Bug on select, otherwise addresses base expectations, no extensions
More tests needed, to cover existing methods and supporting methods
Breaking logic into components: need to go farther here
Enumerables solid
1. Functional Expectations

2: Application is missing one base expectation
2. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
5. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## Team

### Projects

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Notes:

Repo here: https://github.com/brandonrandall/1608
Missing sort
TDD: would like to see more unit tests and node/tree divided into different files
Style solid: nice and tight methods
Recursion used to implement functionality where appropriate
Scores:

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

2: Application is missing one base expectation
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
5. Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

## Community

### Giving Feedback
(feedback from me)
  I dont really feel qualified to give coding feedback yet but I do think this is an enjoyable field and Id
  like more time to learn the basics before continuing.

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)


### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

Id like to keep trying to portray positivity at all times and would like to eventually be able to teach those who need help.
