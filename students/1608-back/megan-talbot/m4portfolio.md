-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment


Satisfactory Progress

* 3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.

Ruby & Rails Style & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Javascript Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

User Interface

* 3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

Documentation

* 3: Project features excellent documentation showing how to develop the application

Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual work in module 4 only consisted of contibution to an open source project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Mod 4 essentially consisted of 3 group projects. We had Quantified Self, which was a 2 week Javascript project. Then we had 2 'sprints' on our Capstone project, MentorSHIP.  Lastly, we had a smaller scale side project during the final 2 weeks which was called Mashup.  Looking back, Quantified Self feels like a long time ago, but it was very useful. The capstone projects felt more like actual team projects on a job, which has been challenging but also rewarding. The final side project was done with our Capstone groups.


### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mscherer11/quantified-self)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

Quantified Self was a pair project in which we made a calorie tracker entirely in Javascript. This was definitely a hard project as it was so new, but I can safely say that I learned a lot. I wish there had been more time to polish up our final project, but we worked very hard to get where we did, so I am satisfied with what we submitted. 

#### Evaluation Comments: 
* Teensy bug with the icon.
* 40 tests. 
* Filtering requires a refresh. 
* Would like to have seen some dry. 
* What bugs do exist are very minor.

#### Evaluation Scores: 
Functional Expectations
- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

Testing
- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

HTML/CSS/UI
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

JS syntax and Style
- 3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

Git Workflow
- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

Project Management
- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

#### Evaluation Notes: 
- Technical conversation happens on PR's in Github. Functionality conversations happen in Pivotal on the feature card.
- You guys have been doing a great job with Pivotal Tracker
- New Git/Github Workflow
  - Branch from development for a feature
  - Create a PR back into development
    - Create a descriptive PR, and get at least one other person to comment on it
    - You are encouraged to tag @neight-allen on your PR for any technical commentary
  - We'll code freeze at some point and make a release Branch
  - Bug fixes are merged into that release Branch
  - Release is merged to master and development when we're ready for it to go to production

#### Evaluation Scores: 
Project Management
- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.

Completion & Pace
- 3: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner.

Application of Techniques
- 3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.

From Ben Pepper:<br>
It was a pleasure working with Megan again. Her dedication to the project and making things work is inspiring. Her ability to get thrown into a new situation and then fully grasp the concept was stunning and something I hope to emulate soon.
<br>
Megan, You always produce amazing apps with stunning code. You should always be proud of what you produce no matter what it is. I know we didn't get as far as you would have liked in MentorSHIP but the code we produced was good and sets up 1610 for a strong start. The work you put into the front end made the site easily navigable and easy to look at.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module4/projects/secondary.md)

Mashup was our secondary project, in which we made an interface for users to sort groups of turing students based on differnet paramaters.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown )

This gear up was conducted in our cohorts, which I really enjoyed. I was familiar with this phrase as a economic term, and it was intrersting to see it described in a more socially impactful way.  Also, I really loved that we used an interesting technology to explore this subject.

#### Automation

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

I was happy to be co-lead of the Bezos Posse with Jon Kimble this module. We have both been active member since our first mods, and I think we did a great job leading. We had 2 speakers and co-led 3 spike sessions. They were An Intro to Bezos, Pitching, and User Testing. 

I also paired 4 times with module 1 students. spreadsheet


### Giving Feedback

To Mike:

Mike was a great partner for Quantified Self. This was a hard project and I was glad to have Mike with me for it.  He is a super hard worker and never gave up. Considering this project was in a language we both know relatively little about, I was impressed by Mike's grasp of it as well as his quick ability to learn. I know we both wished we could have polished up our final product more and refactored a bit, but I was very satisifed with our progress. I would gladly work with Mike again!
