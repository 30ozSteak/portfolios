## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)


### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mscherer11/quantified-self)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

Quantified Self was a pair project in which we made a calorie tracker entirely in Javascript. This was definitely a hard project as it was so new, but I can safely say that I learned a lot. I wish there had been more time to polish up our final project, but we worked very hard to get where we did, so I am satisfied with what we submitted. 

#### Evaluation Comments: 
* Teensy bug with the icon.
* 40 tests. 
* Filtering requires a refresh. 
* Would like to have seen some dry. 
* What bugs do exist are very minor.

#### Evaluation Scores: 
Functional Expectations
- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

Testing
- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

HTML/CSS/UI
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

JS syntax and Style
- 3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

Git Workflow
- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

Project Management
- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

From Ben Pepper:<br>
It was a pleasure working with Megan again. Her dedication to the project and making things work is inspiring. Her ability to get thrown into a new situation and then fully grasp the concept was stunning and something I hope to emulate soon.
<br>
Megan, You always produce amazing apps with stunning code. You should always be proud of what you produce no matter what it is. I know we didn't get as far as you would have liked in MentorSHIP but the code we produced was good and sets up 1610 for a strong start. The work you put into the front end made the site easily navigable and easy to look at.

### Giving Feedback

To Mike:

Mike was a great partner for Quantified Self. This was a hard project and I was glad to have Mike with me for it.  He is a super hard worker and never gave up. Considering this project was in a language we both know relatively little about, I was impressed by Mike's grasp of it as well as his quick ability to learn. I know we both wished we could have polished up our final product more and refactored a bit, but I was very satisifed with our progress. I would gladly work with Mike again!
