## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)


### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mscherer11/quantified-self)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

Quantified Self was a pair project in which we made a calorie tracker entirely in Javascript. This was definitely a hard project as it was so new, but I can safely say that I learned a lot. I wish there had been more time to polish up our final project, but we worked very hard to get where we did, so I am satisfied with what we submitted. 

#### Evaluation Comments: 
* Teensy bug with the icon.
* 40 tests. 
* Filtering requires a refresh. 
* Would like to have seen some dry. 
* What bugs do exist are very minor.

#### Evaluation Scores: 
##### Functional Expectations
- 3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

##### Testing
- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

##### HTML/CSS/UI
- 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.

##### JS syntax and Style
- 3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

##### Git Workflow
- 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

##### Project Management
- 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Mike:

Mike was a great partner for Quantified Self. This was a hard project and I was glad to have Mike with me for it.  He is a super hard worker and never gave up. Considering this project was in a language we both know relatively little about, I was impressed by Mike's grasp of it as well as his quick ability to learn. I know we both wished we could have polished up our final product more and refactored a bit, but I was very satisifed with our progress. I would gladly work with Mike again!
