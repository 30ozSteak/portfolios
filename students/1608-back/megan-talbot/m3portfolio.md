# Megan Talbot - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I hope so gain a deeper understanding of Rails. I also want to learn more about consuming APIs and building my own. 
Additionally, I want to prepare myself for interviews by focusing on exercisms every week. I hope to make new contacts in both the Boston and Denver areas through a dedicated outreach effort.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (API Curious)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/api-curious-github)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

This project focused on learning how to consume an external API. We were able to choose a popular API to then consume it to essentially recreate the website on our own. I chose Github and was very happy with my results! I was nervous about learning how to conusme and API, but this project was very helpful because we had to do it many times. I'm happy to say I am very comfortable consuming an API.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Rails Engine)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/rails-engine-api)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

This project had us create our own RESTful API to display sales data.  We built single-responsibility controllers to expose many different record endpoints, as well as more complex business relationship endpoints. This required advanced active record queries, which was very challenging but also very rewarding.  It was a hard project but I learned a ton! I thought building an API would be much more complicted than it was. I also learned about customzing JSON output and a lot more about queries databases.
