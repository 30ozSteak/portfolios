# Megan Talbot - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I entered this module with the main goal of gaining a deeper understanding of Rails. I also wanted to learn more about consuming APIs and building my own, as I had essentially no experience with APIs prior. 
Additionally, I aimed to prepare myself for interviews by focusing on exercisms every week. I also hoped to make new contacts in both the Boston and Denver areas through a dedicated outreach effort.

I am happy to say I have accomplished all of my goals! I feel much more comfortable with Rails and I also know a lot about API consumption and construction. I have done my best to focus on exercisms outside of class, and I hope to continue this effort. I think my network has grown in both Boston and in Denver, but I will most definitely keep working on this as well!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/api-curious-github)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

This project focused on learning how to consume an external API. We were able to choose a popular API to then consume it to essentially recreate the website on our own. I chose Github and was very happy with my results! I was nervous about learning how to conusme and API, but this project was very helpful because we had to do it many times. I'm happy to say I am very comfortable consuming an API.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/rails-engine-api)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

This project had us create our own RESTful API to display sales data.  We built single-responsibility controllers to expose many different record endpoints, as well as more complex business relationship endpoints. This required advanced active record queries, which was very challenging but also very rewarding.  It was a hard project but I learned a ton! I thought building an API would be much more complicted than it was. I also learned about customzing JSON output and a lot more about queries databases.


__***Evaluation:***__

*Feedback to Alisher:*<br>
Alisher was such a supportive and helpful partner for Rales Engine!  He was always willing to try new things and very open to feedback. This was a hard project but I was very happy with our results. I unfortunately had a funeral on the last day of this project, but Alisher never missed a beat when offering to handle the eval on his own. He was very thoughtful in making sure I gained all of the  information that I could have missed, and I appreicate his eagerness to be there  for me in that way!


### Cloney Island

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/pushpin)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)

This project had us create a total application from scratch. Our group built a platform called "Pushpin", which was based off of the website Thumbtack, where people can request home improvement services.  This project had many new challenges, as we had many different levels of authorization (admin, professionals, requesters, and guests), as well as new functionality that we had never done before, such as messaging systems and two-factor authrntication.  I think we all thought that our final product was not exactly where we wanted it to be by the end of the project, but I still left very satisfied as I learned lots of new things. Part of me wishes we had more time to finish it exactly, but we did a great job with the scope and time frame we had!




 __**Evaluation Comments:**__<br>
 We self-graded this project and were relatively hard on ourselves, as we all wanted a perfect final product! Sally said she agreed with the grades we gave ourselves which are below. It essentially works out to all 3's (one 2.5 and one 3.5) and we did get the extra point for pushing ouselves to try something new. 

 __**Evaluation Scores:**__

### Client Expectations

**Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.**
* **3: As expected**

**Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.**
* **2.5: (As expected / Below expectations)**

**Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.**
* **3: As expected**

### Technical Expectations 

**Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.**
* **3: As expected**

### Test Quality
**Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?**
* **3.5: (As expected / Better than expected)** 

### Code Quality
**Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.**
* **3: As expected**

###Bonus

**Did the team push themselves by taking risks?**
* **1: Yes**

 __**Feedback:**__
 
*Feedback from Ryan:*<br>
Megan was an excellent team member on Cloney Island. I repeatedly saw her jump on whichever part of the project needed her, even if it wasn't an easy or glamorous task like user ratings. Though at times we faced difficult problems, pairing with Megan was always a positive experience, and I am grateful that we had the chance to work on a team while at Turing.



## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown
)

I unfortunately missed this Gear Up, as I was in Chicago for a funeral. :(

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

This was a fun gear up. I liked that it focused on something we will have to actively consider on the job - effectively designing for users. The basic premise of journey mapping is identifying the "journey" the user will take while doing something (like using your software) and identifying opportunities and weaknesses of this journey in a timeline/map format.  We split into groups and tried it out, journey mapping both the experience of getting a new driver's license and completing your first Turing project. I will definitely take the lessons from this gear up with me as I move forward, and try to remember to consider the user's journey when designing any sofware.


#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

The last gear up of this module focused on grit. Though grit has become a bit of a buzzword, it is obviously an important quality. I particularly liked the article that noted the criticisms of grit,  where they said that grit only matters if it is coupled with passion. We talked a lot in my group about grit as a Turing student, which we all undoubtedly have. Much like the resistance gear up, however, we also talked about how it's important to reflect on grit inwardly and not focus on telling others to have more grit, as this can easily trend toward victim blaming. I liked doing this gear up in our cohorts and definitely appreciate the grit in myself throughout this whole experience!
