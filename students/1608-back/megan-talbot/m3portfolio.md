# Megan Talbot - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I hope so gain a deeper understanding of Rails. I also want to learn more about consuming APIs and building my own. 
Additionally, I want to prepare myself for interviews by focusing on exercisms every week. I hope to make new contacts in both the Boston and Denver areas.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

#### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (API Curious)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/api-curious-github)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

This project focused on learning how to consume an external API. We were able to choose a popular API to then consume it to essentially recreate the website on our own. I chose Github and was very happy with my results! I was nervous about learning how to conusme and API, but this project was very helpful because we had to do it many times.
