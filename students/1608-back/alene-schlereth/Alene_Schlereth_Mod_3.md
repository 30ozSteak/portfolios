#### Rales_Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

In this project, students:
Learn how to to build Single-Responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API.
Learn how to use controller tests to drive your design.
Use Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more complicated business intelligence.

Test coverage is strong, but specs could be stronger to ensure exact expectations are returned correctly (for example, set up top merchants by x quantity spec to have specific merchant sell most, then assert that merchant came back first)
Items search controller could use refactoring with various params cases, otherwise code is well-refactored

(evaluation scores)
4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.  
4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.  
4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.  
4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

Microaggressions are more pervasive than most people realize.  This is, in part what makes a microaggression. Often those perpetuating them do not realize the impact their comments have on other people. Our group discussed some lived experiences of microaggressions as well as touched on how perhaps the different genders respond to different incidents. 

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

Coming in to this gear up, I had anticipated talking about our personal story. It was a pleasant surprise to find that it was about a tool used to think through user experiences. I enjoyed the structured conversation with my partner and getting to direct the interview whichever way I felt was appropriate.   

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Networking w/ Lia

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

When meeting people in a networking environment, you will need to approach conversations ready to talk about yourself.  During this activity we practiced telling our story and honing the story arch. We also discussed how to navigate initiating conversations at large networking events. 

#### Job Search Strategies w/ Meg

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bh5e_k23Spm_4w9nEmUgdWWmQ_3pl6F5cusr19tLG-4/edit?usp=sharing)

After graduating from Turing, we will need to hit the ground running to find a job in a timely manner.  During this session we planned out what we could be doing now to build relationships which we can rely on during the job search.
