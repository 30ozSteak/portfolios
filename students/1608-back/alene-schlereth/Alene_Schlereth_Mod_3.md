#### Apicurious :: Github Clone

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

This project utilizes an Oauth process, handrolled without OmniAuth, as well as the GitHub API. User functionality for a single profile page includes displaying all repositories for a user, their followers, who they are following, starred respositories, organizations, and personal contact information. Each of these hitting a different endpoint. Styling also attempts to mirror the styling of GitHub itself.

#### Rales_Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

In this project, students:
Learn how to to build Single-Responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API.
Learn how to use controller tests to drive your design.
Use Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more complicated business intelligence.

Test coverage is strong, but specs could be stronger to ensure exact expectations are returned correctly (for example, set up top merchants by x quantity spec to have specific merchant sell most, then assert that merchant came back first)
Items search controller could use refactoring with various params cases, otherwise code is well-refactored

(evaluation scores)
4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.  
4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.  
4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.  
4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

#### CloneyIsland :: Pushpin

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/pushpin)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island)

Pushpin is a clone of [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/) . Our group built this website utilizing multi tenancy for four user roles. I enjoyed digging into S3 for file storage, Twilio 2Factor Authentication,  Intricate DB relationships, and building out a Post endpoint for an internal API.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

Microaggressions are more pervasive than most people realize.  This is, in part what makes a microaggression. Often those perpetuating them do not realize the impact their comments have on other people. Our group discussed some lived experiences of microaggressions as well as touched on how perhaps the different genders respond to different incidents. 

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

Coming in to this gear up, I had anticipated talking about our personal story. It was a pleasant surprise to find that it was about a tool used to think through user experiences. I enjoyed the structured conversation with my partner and getting to direct the interview whichever way I felt was appropriate.  

#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

I have a hard time with the term Grit and repercussions of its popularity. I agree with a lot of the commentary from the first article.  There is some merit to the idea, but the idea is not entirely a new one. In currently implementation it often is shallow and has a blame the vicitm air about it. I am however, a big supporter of growth mindset type learning opportunities and detaching failure from the idea of being a failure.  

### Professional Development Workshops

(takeaways from session)

#### Networking w/ Lia

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/networking.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

When meeting people in a networking environment, you will need to approach conversations ready to talk about yourself.  During this activity we practiced telling our story and honing the story arch. We also discussed how to navigate initiating conversations at large networking events. 

#### Job Search Strategies w/ Meg

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bh5e_k23Spm_4w9nEmUgdWWmQ_3pl6F5cusr19tLG-4/edit?usp=sharing)

After graduating from Turing, we will need to hit the ground running to find a job in a timely manner.  During this session we planned out what we could be doing now to build relationships which we can rely on during the job search.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Pahlka Posse:  
As a co-leader of Pahlka Posse, I have enjoyed supporting our team in getting things done. This module, we set up our work flow differently than in the past. Friday Spike sessions were formatted as tutorials/code alongs where we Pahlka memebers learned about and then lead a session on a tech topic/skill that was applicable to what we needed to learn to build our app.  These included PDF scraper, d3/LoDash, API Building, and Security. This spread the leadership amongst more Pahlka members and made our Friday Spike sessions more meaningful for visitors.  

from Schuttte: Ali deserves a wealth of gratitude and appreciation for her work on this module’s Pahlka project. As I was struggling to keep my head above water, I was always amazed to see new and meaningful PR’s from her on our Edualize project. She has seemingly endless endurance, and her passion for making a difference is contagious to all that interact with her. I’m grateful for having learned a bit about thinking beyond my own work this module, and can’t wait to see what Ali does with her incredible drive.  

Productivity Lunch:  
Attended weekly productivity lunch where I built relationships and talked about strategies for a healthier happier, more productive life.  I enjoyed chatting with this group of people from week to week.  

Joan Clarke Society:  
Attended weekly Joan Clarke Society coffee where I built relationships with fellow female Turing devs across cohorts and with alumni. I really appreciated the opportunity to ask questions and gain advice on developement work, group project dynamics, and general balancing life as a Turing student.
