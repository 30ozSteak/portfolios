(Intro)

#### Quantify Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/quantify-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

A Calorie Tracker - Food/Exercise built in JavaScript. This application utilizes localStorage to hold information across multiple days for multiple meals. 

17 tests, all feature tests, all passing.
Would like to have seen some sad path testing
Opportunity to refactor with code duplication in Diary.
Fully functional, no bugs.

3: Application has all functionality, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect  
3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.  
3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML Classes and IDs are kebab case.    
3: Uses classes as modules. DRY code where appropriate. Attention payed to indentation and naming.   
3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature  
4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Universal Basic Income

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

There are lots of complexities here. We discussed what this would look like across the country with such a variance in cost of living. We also discussed how some of the options in laying it out would not in the end fix income inequality and poverty. It was also important to think about what happens if people are out of work, how does this impact their self worth. 

#### Tradgedy of the Commons 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

I really liked the triangle/square exercise. There was someone in my group who disagreed with the idea of affirmative action, we had a nice respectful conversation. It was great to explore action steps from another point of view.

#### Automation and the Future 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Automation is likely inevitable. It was interesting to hear how different people thought about what it means for the future. There were a couple folks in my group/room who were fairly outspoken about a couple set ideas, which hindered conversation a bit. 

### Professional Development Workshops

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

from Ben:   
Ali is an amazing partner. Her grasp of JQuery and Javascript is stunning. She made Quantified Self far more tolerable and her enthusiasm when something finally worked was refreshing. Ali is more than capable as a programer and as a member of any team that she has been or will be a part of.

### Playing a Part

Pahlka Posse:
* Efforts toward Pahlka Posse continuing after the current four Mod4 folks graduate. We revamped a bit of how Spikes and our weekly lunch work to be more inclusive and build relationships. Personally this mod, I focused on stepping back as a leader and supporting the current leaders to ensure Pahlka's continued success. 
* Continued to build
