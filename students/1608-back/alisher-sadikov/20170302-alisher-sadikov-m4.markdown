##### Instructor Feedback:

## C: Individual Work

#### Open Source Contribution

The project I found was https://www.ossboard.org which is a platform that connects developers and open-source maintainers. It sounded like and also was exactly something that would promote open source. So I took on a seemingly simple task of building functionality that rebuilds a portion of user show page related to displaying github repositories they own. Little did I know that in spite of looking like a rails project, this app was actually built with Hanami framework and that I was going to break tests because of dependencies. So it took me 3-4 time more effort to actually understand Hanami and fix tests than to build the functionality needed.

## D: Feedback & Community Participation

#### Pairing With Students in Lower Modules

I paired with lower module students as many times as I could with my limited time, including Eric Wahlgren (1610-backend) and Sergey Lukyanenko (1701-backend).

#### Exercism Fun Workshop (Friday Spike)

I co-lead a Friday spike with Michael Scherer, Chase Dunagan and Anna Dolan on 02/24/2017. Pretty much students from all modules were present and we covered general exercism setup/workflow, as well as tackled exercisms in Ruby, JavaScript and Elixir.

#### Gear Up Reflections

My most favorite session was the one about automation. We had a very interesting and heated discussion in our group, as individuals with kind of extreme opposing views were debating. My takeaway was that this topic should not be ignored, but measures should be taken before automation leaves devastating effects on the society, such as mass unemployment, income inequality etc.

The session about universal basic income was also interesting and it seemed like a logical follow-up after automation gear up. However, the minimal reading we did left an impression that this was still a very vague idea that lacks details of implementation and possible effects.


##### Feedback to me:

Sergey Lukyanenko: "As a module 1 student I had many projects and assignments which require hard work and persistence to learn new information. I'm very thankful to have pairing session with Alisher. With his knowledge and experience in programming he patiently and with courage helped me to make my studying process more productive. As a mentor he supported me emotionally and taught me many coding technics. It's been a pleasure  to work with Alisher. I wish him success in his professional career and continue sharing knowledge and experience with Turing family."

Vido Seaver: "Alisher, I really enjoyed pairing with you on Quantified self. It was on of my top three groups while at touring.  Your a hardworker, smart and are great at putting your head down and putting in the work. I also like how we could annoyed with each other and then it would be history and not matter the next day. That ability to move on is not something everyone posses. I donâ€™t really know what to say as far as how you can improve. Maybe being comfortable with the final product? Or not <-redacted-> as much when we are in a small space? I don't know man, I enjoyed working with you. It was great"

##### Feedback from me:

Vido Seaver: "Vido is a hardworking developer with good team spirit. We had a lot fun with him building the Quantified Self app. One striking thing about him that I do not see often among Turing students is enjoying the learning and problem solving sides of programming instead of treating it like a chore. On the constructive side, he already knows what he needs to fix!"

Michael Scherer: "I have worked with Mike for over a month on Monocle and LookingFor projects. He is one of those people who do not get arrogant because of their smartness. This, combined with his outstanding work ethic make him an irreplaceable teammate."

Lee Seville: "I have worked with Lee for over a month on Monocle and LookingFor projects. He has demonstrated great work ethic and put in a lot of hours into the projects. He also has a great team spirit and an is an excellent collaborator."

Chase Dunagan: "I have worked with Chase for over a month on Monocle and LookingFor projects. He is a great guy to be around and good at collaboration. He has good communication skills and understood what needed to be done and where we were at with the projects."

Sergey Lukyanenko: "During our pairing sessions with Sergey I noticed that he was a hard-working guy who put in the hours and made consistent progress from week to week. I also respect the facts that he was finding time to do drills when he was buried under projects, always used TDD etc. I believe he has a bright future as a developer."
