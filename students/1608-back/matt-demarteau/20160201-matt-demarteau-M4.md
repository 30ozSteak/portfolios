# Matt DeMarteau - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I wanted to work on my self-productivity skills.  In Module 4 there was a ton of work we had to keep track of.  Staying organized was a priority and falling behind was not an option.  I worked hard to use time wisely and not leave any time to waste.  I stayed after school many late nights to work on my projects and used any free time I had to work on proffessional development skills.  The module was a lot of work, but the extra time spent on task paid off.

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

There was not an individual project in module 4, but producting for the team as an individual was needed throughout.  Due to the coplexity and scope of the projects in module 4, there was many night spent working alone on a task that would contribute to the group project.  Team members counted on each other to complete there share of the work troughout the mod.  

#### Briefcase

*   [GitHub URL]()
*   [Original Assignment]()

Briefcase was a project where we brought the development of the Turing alumni page in-house.  Although the site works functionally there were many areas that could have been improved.  Bringing the project in-house helped to streamline solving many of the functionality problems.  The main focus for revamping the website was to make it easy for the user to upload a profile.  We added whatever we could get from another app, called Census, to help with the process.
