# Matt DeMarteau - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I wanted to work on my self-productivity skills.  In Module 4 there was a ton of work we had to keep track of.  Staying organized was a priority and falling behind was not an option.  I worked hard to use time wisely and not leave any time to waste.  I stayed after school many late nights to work on my projects and used any free time I had to work on professional development skills.  The module was a lot of work, but the extra time spent on task paid off. 

In the previous module I had to work hard to review my process and make sure I was accomplishing tasks at the speed of a junior developer.  I feel that my attention to process helped me in this module.  I feel that I have become better at managing my time and accomplishing tasks and work on time.

## A: End of Module Assessment Status

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

There was not an individual project in module 4, but producing for the team as an individual was needed throughout.  Due to the complexity and scope of the projects in module 4, there was many night spent working alone on a task that would contribute to the group project.  Team members counted on each other to complete their share of the work throughout the mod.  


## C: Group Work & Projects

The bulk of this module involved working in a group to complete projects.  Although the individual contribution to the group work was important, managing your time with group members and working in a team was essential to passing module 4.  Our first project was a two week pair project called quantified self and the second and third projects where three person projects.  The last two projects were related and we worked in the same three person groups for both.

### Quantified Self

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/quantified-self)
*   [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self)

Quantified Self is a project built in JavaScript and html only hosted on GitHub pages. The time scope of the project was two weeks worked on in a group of two while balancing other responsibilities.  We built an application to record calories for each day’s foods and exercises.  Each day has a goal to hit and each day can be recorded separately.  The project tested our strength of JavaScript and jQuery to sort different foods, filter different foods and update without updating the DOM.  I enjoyed working on this project and thought felt it was a great introduction to testing our abilities to write JavaScript.

Notes:

* Tracker is in good shape
* It actually looks pretty good!
* Functionality appears to work well
* Tests look well structured with some opportunities to isolate repeated functionality / "magic data"
* JavaScript implementation is pretty clean and easy to read/understand

#### Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

#### Functional Expectations

- 3: Application has all functionality

#### Testing

- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.

#### HTML/CSS/UI

- 4: Team used CSS preprocessor and put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes for DOM traversal, and data namespace attributes

#### JS syntax and Style

* 4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate

#### Git Workflow

* 3: Team is using the proper branch types, and has a pull request for each feature

#### Project Management

* 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. It's hard to misinterpret user stories

### Briefcase

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/briefcase/)
*   [Production URL](https://turing-briefcase-production.herokuapp.com)

Briefcase was a project where we brought the development of the Turing alumni page in-house.  Although the site works functionally there were many areas that could have been improved.  Bringing the project in-house helped to streamline solving many of the functionality problems.  The main focus for revamping the website was to make it easy for the user to upload a profile.  We added whatever we could get from another app, called Census, to help with the process.  

Reviewer: Nate

Notes:

- Tag me in 10 PR's over the next sprint and use the template linked in the channel
- More cards as you divide up the big tasks, and write a description
- If you have a conversation about a feature, add a comment on the card with the result of your conversation.
- No testing, so there's a 2 for implementation quality


#### 1. Project Management

* 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.**

#### 2. Completion & Pace

* 3: Team completed all stories scheduled for this checkpoint by the product owner.**

#### 3. Implementation Quality

* 2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or application of MVC principles.**

#### 4. Application of Techniques

* 4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques from the previous two weeks of academic classes.**


### Gadjet

*   [GitHub URL]()
*   [Original Assignment]()

Gadget was a small week long project where we made an application used by faculty to monitor what students are up to date with all their requirements.  You can login to the app and click which cohorts and criteria you would like to query and click analyze.  The application then either makes API calls to GitHub or scrapes LinkedIn to compare the data in the Census application.  A list of student names and whether they are compliant is then generated.  This project showed was a great automation project to help staff with a task that would take a app second to complete.  

Notes from Jeff

* Checking LinkedIn, GitHub matching of names
* Select the fields for review
* Would need Census to require the URLs
* LinkedIn locks you out easily
* Would like to improve speed (needs caching)
* Risk: used begin/rescue, but, uhhhhh, but, uhhhh
* Pitfall: checkboxes with materialize
* Demo: ugh.

Notes from Nate

* Table looks good. Easy to read and audit
* Creating an audit is also easy
* UI doesn't explain itself. You need to tell someone how to use it.
* Nice work rolling with technical challenges, like LinkedIn not having any API
* We're gonna get this in use this week, so we'll let you know how it goes

## D: Professional Skills

Being the last module of the program, the professional skills deliverables were more focused on networking, job searching, and finding the right company to work for.  I enjoyed the professional development regarding cold outreach to employers.  I really believe that networking is the right way to get a job and module 4 professional skills honed our skills to network.  

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

We are confronted daily by social challenges that seem bigger than we are. It's often difficult for us to see the connection between small choices we make and these issues, but they are often connected. And when we can make the connection, it's not always obvious how we can best have an impact. This gear up we learned how the choice of being like you neighbor on a grand scale has drastic impact on the societies diversity impact.  I thought the gear up was very valuable to bring insight to how we approach diversity.  It was easy to see how just a couple people keeping diversity in mind can play a huge role in the dynamics of diversity.  It was also clear to see the impact on society if everyone wanted a percentage of people like them around always.  It opened me up to the role I could play in making society a more diverse place.  

#### Automation

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

This gear up really opened my eyes to automation.  I always thought that automation was far away, but after this gear up, I realize automation is in the forefront of everyones reality.  If we don't act now to realize that automation is going to impact all of us in some way then we are in for a rude awakening.  In my mind, there is action for a huge paradigm shift in the way we work and make money.  I feel lucky to be in the technology industry, but know that automation will affect us as well.  As our technical careers progress, most of the work we will do is to automate processes that have been done manually.  Since we are the ones partaking in the automation process, we must take the ideology and consequences seriously and help to find a tradeoff.  

#### Universal Basic Income

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

 If we don't start thinking about the people who are out of work due to the automation we are going to run our self into a problem where the rich and the poor become increasingly opposite.  The software we write enables its users to be more productive, and to direct energy toward solving increasingly difficult problems. However, some automation, especially of physical processes, can force some out of the jobs they’ve done for years. This has the potential to do more harm than good for inclusion in our society.  If we don't start thinking about the people who are out of work due to the automation we run ourselves into many problems.  I believe that if there is not government interaction in the process we will not survive.  I don't believe that we need to give money out for nothing and there are plenty of jobs to be done in our society.  The government needs to make jobs that benefit the community instead of big business.  Although automation puts many people out of work, there are still volunteer opportunities that we could monetize.  My group talked about the fact that we are looking at the problem in the wrong way and need to invest more in education and revamping the education system to train people who are losing their jobs to automation.  


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

This was my first time working with Daniel, but I had heard many people talk about how great he is to pair with.  I really enjoyed paring on our final projects with Daniel and feel lucky to get to know him as a person.  There was one time during the project that he noticed we were losing steam in the project.  He made sure to bring it up in our retro and asked to pair on the next tasks in the project.  I really appreciated the acknowledgment that the group was losing steam and enjoyed pairing the rest of the project.  I thought we worked well together and delivered a great product.  My only feedback to Daniel is to have more confidence in himself outside of his work ethic.  He would be great on any team and can bring out the best in the teams he works with. He is a great guy and I am happy to have gotten to know him as a person outside of Turing as well.  I really enjoyed the team dynamic we had for our final project and would work with Daniel anytime.

I came into this module from another module and didn't have the chance to work with Anthony on any projects in module 3.  I ended up feeling very lucky to have Anthony as a group member on our final project.  I really enjoyed the team dynamic we had for our final project and it made for my favorite project at Turing.  I didn't mind working late and tacking problems because I really enjoyed the team and working with each other on Briefcase.  I was more than impressed with Anthony's work and felt he contributed to many tough tasks presented in the project.  He is very fast at writing code and getting things done, and specifically helped to take over driving when the team was losing steam.  The only feedback that I would give Anthony is to make sure he knows how strong he is as a coder.  I overheard that he might have been struggling with module 1 and feel he is one of the top programmers in the class.  His contributions to our project showed and I would welcome pairing with Anthony anytime in the future. 

I worked with Lee on our first project in quantified self.  He was a great person to pair with and I thought we worked very well together.  I really value Lee's ability to give 100% all the time.  His work ethic is second to none and I believe he is one of the hardest working students in the class.  I really appreciated his knowledge of coding as well.  I learned a lot working with lee and feel he has some of the best processes when working with code.  He has many shortcuts that help with speedy code delivery and his git workflow is one to be bragged about.  The only advice I would give to Lee is to have confidence in working in teams and let go of the reins a little bit when working in groups.  He has great pride in his projects and code and wants to be a part of every step of the process.  I know that if he works in groups that deliver as much as he does he can do great things.  I would work with Lee in the future anytime.
