# Kailin - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn the fundamentals of Javascript more than anything else. I also wanted to solidfy the CSS skills I had coming in with a strong base, as well as learn how to more easily and quickly lay out a page.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects this mod were Number Guesser and three Static Compositions.

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Goal was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

#### Student: Kailin Cannon
#### Evaluator: David Whitaker
#### Notes/What To Work On:

* Time management! Get started earlier!
* Work on sytax and spacing
* Consider adding comments to CSS for better organization
* Be more verbose and explicit when naming functions and variables

#### Functional Expectations
* Novice: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.  
* Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.  

#### COMP RECREATION / DESIGN
* Advanced Beginner  

#### HTML
* Advanced Beginner  

#### CSS
* Novice
* Advanced Beginner  

#### JS/jQuery
* Novice

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/static-comp)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

My first attempt at using flexbox. Comments were that I needed to fix images so that they're responsive & fix the wonky stuff happening at the bottom of the page when squished.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/kc-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

I was pretty happy with this one, except for the "princesses" section title which kept just wiggling all around on it's own. It's an anarchist. It doesn't care about rules.

Comments I received were that I maybe needed to change the color of the cards based on the background color, and that the cards should always align left even if they don't make up a full row (instead of being centered). Also still need to work on smallest mobile view to avoid lots of 'fat finger' situations. Icons need to change hover color along with text. Less typography fun :(


#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/kc-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Ohhhh my god there's so many elements on this page. Definitely the first time I've run into issues with bouncing back and forth between tasks. On smaller projects it doesn't matter so much, but when there's 75 different things on the page I need to change I need to focus on getting one thing done first before I move on to something else, instead of just doing random amounts of everything.

### EVALUATION PENDING TILL FRIDAY 9AM

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were Linked List, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox-Pivot.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

A small application that used form inputs to append things to the other side of the page, for the purpose of making a little URL bookmark-tracker. There were buttons to delete bookmarks, and to mark a bookmark as 'read'. 

#### Student: Kailin and Amanda
#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### Notes/What To Work On:

- nice UI! just a little tweaking for the counter and the "delete read" button. overall nice layout additions.
- remember that paired projects are as much about compromise and flexibility as they are about getting the work done.
- well formatted code.
- Codebase is in a good place to do a refactor pass -- nice work!

> To start off, the final result of our project was awesome! I was really happy with how it turned out after all of our hard work. Even though at the end we both agreed there were a few things that could've been tweaked, I think we did a great job. As far as the pairing went, I think we were able to work through most issues that came up. We both have very different working styles, and I think that we could both learn from each other. When I am being nitpicky, I am really just trying to get as much as I can out of everything we're learning and start putting into practice the "best practices" we're going to need when we're working. I recognize that maybe you don't usually work like that, but I feel like right now we're in a situation that we should be thorough with our work. In addition, I want to be as thorough as possible with my CSS and I was disappointed that you didn't give me more feedback on the CSS when I asked you since it is one of your strengths. I think the most important part of a pairing project is learning as much as we can both from the actual work itself and from our partner. We all have different strengths in abilities and work styles, and I was excited to learn more about CSS from you and I was hoping to be able to help you with the JavaScript. You're doing a great job at using the resources we have at Turing: people from other mods, our teachers, and other people in our class. Just don't forget that your partner is also a resource. It hurt a little when you went to other people in Mod 4 and in our class before even talking to me about a problem, and I felt kind of dismissed when I asked you about what you were working on and if I could help. I would've loved to be more part of those moments when you were taking advantage of our resources at school. I don't think it was your intention, but there were times when I felt disrespected, for example when I felt dismissed because I didn't fully know jQuery yet, even though I am quite strong and understand the logic behind JavaScript. Again, I don't think that this was your intention, which is why I am telling you these things so that we can both get better at pairing in general. If you want to sit down and talk about this, I would be more than happy to have an open and compassionate conversation. And I think that we should both be really happy with how good-looking and solid our final project came out.

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Our class all pooled together money to buy breakfast burritos for mod2 because of how much they helped us. Personally I don't think I've helped out very much, because I'm just starting out and I feel like I'm usually farther behind than others in the class so I'm not the person people go to for help. Hopefully when pairing in mod2 I can give really clear explanations to people I'm paired with and help out a bit more.
