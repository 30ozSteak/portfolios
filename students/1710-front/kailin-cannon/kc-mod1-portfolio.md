# Kailin - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to learn the fundamentals of Javascript more than anything else. I also wanted to solidfy the CSS skills I had coming in with a strong base, as well as learn how to more easily and quickly lay out a page.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects this mod were Number Guesser and three Static Compositions.

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Goal was to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

#### Student: Kailin Cannon
#### Evaluator: David Whitaker
#### Notes/What To Work On:

* Time management! Get started earlier!
* Work on sytax and spacing
* Consider adding comments to CSS for better organization
* Be more verbose and explicit when naming functions and variables

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/static-comp)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

My first attempt at using flexbox. Comments were that I needed to fix images so that they're responsive & fix the wonky stuff happening at the bottom of the page when squished.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/kc-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

I was pretty happy with this one, except for the "princesses" section title which kept just wiggling all around on it's own. It's an anarchist. It doesn't care about rules.

Comments I received were that I maybe needed to change the color of the cards based on the background color, and that the cards should always align left even if they don't make up a full row (instead of being centered). Also still need to work on smallest mobile view to avoid lots of 'fat finger' situations. Icons need to change hover color along with text. Less typography fun :(


#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/kc-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Ohhhh my god there's so many elements on this page. Definitely the first time I've run into issues with bouncing back and forth between tasks. On smaller projects it doesn't matter so much, but when there's 75 different things on the page I need to change I need to focus on getting one thing done first before I move on to something else, instead of just doing random amounts of everything.

### EVALUATION PENDING TILL FRIDAY 9AM

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were Linked List, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox-Pivot.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

A small application that used form inputs to append things to the other side of the page, for the purpose of making a little URL bookmark-tracker. There were buttons to delete bookmarks, and to mark a bookmark as 'read'. 

#### Student: Kailin and Amanda
#### Evaluator: Louisa
#### Notes/What To Work On:

- nice UI! just a little tweaking for the counter and the "delete read" button. overall nice layout additions.
- remember that paired projects are as much about compromise and flexibility as they are about getting the work done.
- well formatted code.
- Codebase is in a good place to do a refactor pass -- nice work!

#### Feedback Received:
> To start off, the final result of our project was awesome! I was really happy with how it turned out after all of our hard work. Even though at the end we both agreed there were a few things that could've been tweaked, I think we did a great job. As far as the pairing went, I think we were able to work through most issues that came up. We both have very different working styles, and I think that we could both learn from each other. When I am being nitpicky, I am really just trying to get as much as I can out of everything we're learning and start putting into practice the "best practices" we're going to need when we're working. I recognize that maybe you don't usually work like that, but I feel like right now we're in a situation that we should be thorough with our work. In addition, I want to be as thorough as possible with my CSS and I was disappointed that you didn't give me more feedback on the CSS when I asked you since it is one of your strengths. I think the most important part of a pairing project is learning as much as we can both from the actual work itself and from our partner. We all have different strengths in abilities and work styles, and I was excited to learn more about CSS from you and I was hoping to be able to help you with the JavaScript. You're doing a great job at using the resources we have at Turing: people from other mods, our teachers, and other people in our class. Just don't forget that your partner is also a resource. It hurt a little when you went to other people in Mod 4 and in our class before even talking to me about a problem, and I felt kind of dismissed when I asked you about what you were working on and if I could help. I would've loved to be more part of those moments when you were taking advantage of our resources at school. I don't think it was your intention, but there were times when I felt disrespected, for example when I felt dismissed because I didn't fully know jQuery yet, even though I am quite strong and understand the logic behind JavaScript. Again, I don't think that this was your intention, which is why I am telling you these things so that we can both get better at pairing in general. If you want to sit down and talk about this, I would be more than happy to have an open and compassionate conversation. And I think that we should both be really happy with how good-looking and solid our final project came out.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jjlljj/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

A project where someone could save ideas they had by entering them into input fields that would append to the page. The idea could be upvoted or downvoted in quality and there were search and filtering options for the ideas.

## Student: James and Kailin
## Evaluator: David
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Nice work on the filtering extension!

#### HTML
* Work on proper indentation ie body should be tabbed in one from the html tags
* Make sure that spacing is consistent in html - ideally the tabbing should be enough and additional spaces should not be necessary

#### CSS
* Work on indentation and spacing in css
* Consider adding a typography section where the base font-family, weight and size are all declared
* Look for duplication in declaration blocks and try to extract similar pieces 

#### JS
* Work on passing objects instead of object properties
* Work on decoupling the data model from the markup ie. the card 
* Work on more consistent spacing and indentation(no need for blank lines in functions)
* Try to use more array prototypes in place of for loops
* Look for duplication in functions and try to extract those similar lines into their own functions that take arguments

## Functional Expectations
* Exceptional The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### HTML

#### Accessibility
* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
* Exceptional Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.

#### Style

* Advanced Beginner Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.

### CSS

#### Structure of Code
* Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

#### Implementation
* Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

### JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types
* Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.
* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

#### Conditional Logic
* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

#### Functions & Scope
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

#### Arrays
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

#### Objects & Prototypes
* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

#### DOM Manipulation
* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

#### Style
* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.

### GIT & GITHUB

#### Git
* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

#### Github
* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

### DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

### PAIRING

#### Collaboration
* Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.
* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Our class all pooled together money to buy breakfast burritos for mod2 because of how much they helped us. Personally I don't think I've helped out very much, because I'm just starting out and I feel like I'm usually farther behind than others in the class so I'm not the person people go to for help. Hopefully when pairing in mod2 I can give really clear explanations to people I'm paired with and help out a bit more.
