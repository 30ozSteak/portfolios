# Michelle Hoffman - M3

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to get a solid understanding of React and api calls and focus on testing my applications. I left Mod 2 feeling a bit confused about api calls especially and wanted to be comfortable with them. I also feel a lot better about testing, but it still feels a tad confusing every once in a while.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### SWapi-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellehoffman/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

##### Description

This project was a challenge for me because I had felt confused about making api calls going into the mod and this forced us to return multiple promises at once and call multiple endpoints. I thought the testing was especially tough for this project.

##### Evaluation Comments
* focus is in the right place. Developer cares about performance and user experience

##### Evaluation Scores
Specification Adherence
3 - The application completes all 4 iterations. having a complete application.

Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

CSS/Design
3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

Testing
3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

Workflow
4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

#### Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/michellehoffman/personal-project)

##### Description

I was really excited about this project! I've had this idea in mind since I started Turing, along with a ton of other ideas. I'm proud to be at a point where I can begin to pursue passion projects. I felt very involved in this project and hope to keep working on it outside of Turing. 

##### Evaluation Scores

Completion
3.5: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

CSS/Design
4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

Redux Architecture
3 - All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don't hold unnecessary data.

Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

Testing
3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Headcount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

##### Description

This project challenged Bruce and I to figure out how to manipulate our data. We'd never had to sift through that much data before, but overall the project was fairly straightforward and provided some challenge. I was really proud of how well we did on this project.

##### Evaluation Scores
Specification Adherence
3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

CSS/Design
4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

Testing
4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

Workflow
3+ - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/wagasky/movie-tracker)

##### Description

I enjoyed the challenge of logging a user in and finally understanding what the post method does in a fetch. Our group met with Watts during the week and found it extremely helpful when he walked through the steps of how to log a user in. After we worked through that and figured out how to set up our project, none of the remaining specs were any harder than previous projects. 

##### Evaluation Scores

PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

5 - Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…
4 - Zero complaints

Redux Architecture
4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

Routing
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

Workflow
4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense.
