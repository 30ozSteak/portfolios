## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellehoffman/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The first project in the front-end program was Number Guesser. I stuggled a TON on this project, but overall I'm really proud of how it came out. I had a hard time asking for help because I felt like I was behind the rest of the class. I didn't have much experience with JavaScript before school started, so it was hard to do this project on my own. That being said, I feel like I learned a lot more by struggling through this one and felt pretty comfortable going into the next project.
