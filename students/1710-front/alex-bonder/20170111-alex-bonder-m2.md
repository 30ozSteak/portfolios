Gear Up

(Session 1) - Empathy

GitHub URL - https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown

  The main takeaway that I had from this gear up session is that people need to realize that they do have biases about their lives and the lives of other people. They need to be able to recognize that the biases are something we're programmed to believe, but they don't resemble the truth. It's important for everyone to recognize the biases they hold and actively fight against them. We discussed in our group that sometimes our first thought is what we're told to think, but our second thought is what we actually think. Its important to know that everyone comes from a different background and therefore we each have different stories and different perceptions of the same things that happen around us. 


(Session - 2) Attention Economy

GitHub URL - https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Attention_Economy.md

  The discussion about the attnetion economy made a lot of sense to me. As an avid social media user I experience it all the time. I've heard all of the tricks that the companies use to try and get people attached to their websites. This gear up did help me focus my attention to where my attention is going. When I did homework over the weekend I made sure to use a pom timer and only allowed my attention to be taken by social media during breaks. One intersting question we were asked is whose responsibility is it to manage our attention, ours or the business. At first I figured you can't stop a business from doing what it wasnts so the responsiblity falls on the user. A person in my group mentioned that the businesses are actively exploiting a flaw in human biology to attract our attention, which did open me to the possibility that the businesses should be responsible. But I still feel it's near impossible to stop a business from doing what it wants to do. All they care about is what brings money in. Their money comes in through our attention, so they'll do whatever it takes to get it.
