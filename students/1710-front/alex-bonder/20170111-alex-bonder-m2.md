Gear Up

(Session 1) - Empathy

GitHub URL - https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown

  The main takeaway that I had from this gear up session is that people need to realize that they do have biases about their lives and the lives of other people. They need to be able to recognize that the biases are something we're programmed to believe, but they don't resemble the truth. It's important for everyone to recognize the biases they hold and actively fight against them. We discussed in our group that sometimes our first thought is what we're told to think, but our second thought is what we actually think. Its important to know that everyone comes from a different background and therefore we each have different stories and different perceptions of the same things that happen around us.
