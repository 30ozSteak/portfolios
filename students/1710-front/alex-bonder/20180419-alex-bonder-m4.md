  Before Turing I didn’t care about who I worked for or what I did. I never had a passion for my career. I was working in retail at Verizon Wireless. All I wanted leaving retail was to get away from customers, and to get weekends and evenings back. I chose software engineering because I’m good with technology, I’m good with puzzles, I have a logical mind, and I like to build things. I wasn’t running toward software development as much as I was running away from retail.

I heard about Turing from my cousin who went to Hungry Academy. I happened to have a weekend off the same time as a Try Coding event so I took a trip out to Colorado. And my cohort started the same week my lease ended in my last apartment. I’m not highly superstitious, or religious, but sometimes even coincidences are a little too obvious to not read in to. Intermission between mods 1-2, My niece was born. Intermission between Mods 2-3 was the week my half marathon happened. Nothing needed to be rescheduled or moved, I didn’t have to miss any school. Everything fell into place. The intermission between Mods 3-4, was eye opening. I just made my personal project and I was preparing it for Demo Comp. I was running on pure adrenaline. I loved creating my first application. From concept to creation. I also took a trip to New York. I did some networking with people who were searching for jobs. The culture was completely different. They sounded so defeated.“Employers don’t want junior devs” “All the jobs are front/back end”“There’s too much competition out there”It reminded me of everything i’ve been hearing for the past 3 mods which was exactly the opposite of all of those things.I realized then.. I’m the one with the passion.I know I can find a job within 30 days if I follow the turing plan.But the question still remained...I LOVED making my app.Thinking about all the ways I want to improve it is so exciting for me.But I knew I needed to find a job where I can hone my skills even further. And I need industry experience.Something that set me apart returning to Mod 4 is that I had to prepare for Demo Comp, while also drafting my resume, cover letter, and Learning Node.js and ExpressIt went kind of like this:I got this. But also, everything is on fire.After Demo Comp Things settled down and life was more like this:I learned Node.js very quickly.As Louisa would say, very little sadness.What it confirmed for me is that the turing process works.I learned how to learn. If i can pick up Node.js and Express this quickly, I can learn anything.I learned that whatever job I get, I’ll be able to pick up their tech stack with relative ease.What really helped me find my passion was our project BYOB.I’m not big on history. I have minimal interest in historical buildings.I had no interest in the topic for the app we were building.But here’s the thing.As I was building out the backend, Writing the code, solving the problems, writing the tests.The whole time, this was me:This project is the one that made me realize that it’s not about the topic, or the project.I love coding.I found my passion.Writing the code, solving the problem, writing the tests, doing the thing.I get so much excitement and satisfaction through code.This project is the one that taught me that I can really work anywhere.All I need to find is a job where I’m even remotely interested in the product, and it’s on.I found my passion.
When the Final Assessment came along, It felt a lot like this to me.I found my passion, I have the skills. Probably just opinion.Everyone was talking about all the struggles they had on the final, I found I wasn’t able to relate.For me it went very smoothly.

But of course, with any good story, there’s an act 2.

Near the end of Mod 4 we were finishing up our capstone and trying to get it deployed to Heroku, via Travis CI.

Nothing I tried worked. I Just couldn’t get it to work.

At first I was handling it pretty well.

I know that it’s ok to not know how to do something as long as you can figure it out.

The next problem was that I wasn’t able to figure it out.

That’s when I started feeling more like Dwight over there.

Everything snowballed for me.

If I can’t figure this out, how can I confidently say I’m good at this?

What does it mean if I can’t figure out this deployment?

I’ve done this school thing. I was a film major. I don’t work in film. I went to bartending school. I’m not a bartender. I took an IT course. I don’t work in IT.

I started worrying that this is just going to follow the same path. 

I went to other students, mentors, teachers, google. Everything. And I couldn’t get it.

I felt defeated.

After a long walk and a talk it was brought to my attention that

with the exception of the worrying that i’m doing is pointless,

I was actually doing it right.

The whole time.

I didn’t know what to do... So I tried to figure it out.

I couldn’t figure it out… So I asked for help.

I used my humans. And THAT is just as much a part of coding as solving code problems.

And at the end of it all. We DID get it deployed.

During my talk I realized that I actually did it right.

I learned that sometimes code can be very hard. 

But I also learned that my instincts guided me in the right direction.

Mod 4 taught me that I do know what I’m doing here.

Every challenge, every victory, every wave of overwhelming stress. It’s all part of doing the thing.

The failures. The stress. Those are all Temporary.

But every passed test. Every completed project. Every puzzle that I solve. It makes it all worth it.

I can’t even count the times at turing that i’ve stayed up all night coding. Not even tired. Not stressed.

Just so into the code. So absorbed by the love of coding.

In my next job, and every job after that. I’m going to bring my passion with me.

Turing taught me that I can love what I do for a living.

I worked 80 Hours a week for 7 months.

I can do whatever it takes to get a job I love and succeed in it.

But I know I have to do the work. Things won’t just happen.

----

I’m going to fail. Probably often. But every time I fail I’m going to come back stronger. And I’m going to be victorious eventually.

The only true failure is giving up.

----

I’ve never been able to say it, and Technically I can’t say it yet because i’m currently employed.

But I’m about to find a job where I love what I do.

----

Turing taught me that not only is this kind of like possible. It also taught me how to make it happen.

I can’t explain how excited I am for the next step.
