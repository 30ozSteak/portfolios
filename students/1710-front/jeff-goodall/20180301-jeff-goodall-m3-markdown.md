# Jeff Goodall - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal was to learn as much as I could. I started off hesitant that it would difficult to "teach this old dog new tricks" but I was able to find myself fitting in pretty well with my class. Even though I feel very much like i am drinking from a fire hose on full, I have been picking up everything that has been laid down. I have jumped into projects head first and come away feeling accomplished and capable. I have gone into assesments and been compleatly confused and worked my way (poking the bear) until I found a solution. I have waken up in the middle of the night and pulled out my computer to code a solution that has been on my mind. I have sought help from everyone around me including my teachers, students in my mod and mod's above and below me. I have drank from the fire hose on full force and prevailed!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### SWapi-Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

# SWapi-Box Eval

##### Evaluator:Christie
##### Students: Jeff Goodall
##### Comments: Nested fetches should be broken out into separate functions... this way you can test them

##### Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 4 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

##### Code Quality

4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
2 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.
1 - Developer did not make any effort to use React effectively or refactor code.

##### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

##### Testing

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

##### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

##### Workflow

3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### HeadCount2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.

##### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.

##### Code Quality

- 4- - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

##### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

##### Testing

- 4- - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

##### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

##### Workflow

- 3+ - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/goodalls/movie-tracker-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. 

##### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes all 2 iterations.

##### Code Quality

- 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

##### CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes. Follows [10 Essential Usability Guidelines.](https://speckyboy.com/10-essential-web-application-usability-guidelines/)

##### Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

##### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

##### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

##### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

##### Routing

* 4-: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

##### Workflow

- 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have supported the community by attending every friday morning talk this mod. I taught Iron FE twice. I have been open minded about the diversity in the class room and I must admit that it is more diverce then I have been around in a long time if ever. I am a part of the school community just by being here and standing up to learn more about our vision statement. I am a better person for being here.
