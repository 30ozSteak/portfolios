# James Logue Mod4 Portfolio

#### Both markdown document and slide presentation are to tell the same story, and should address the following questions:

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

#### The presentation should not only be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).
