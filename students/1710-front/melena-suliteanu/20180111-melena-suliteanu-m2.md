## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod I worked on two individual projects: Sorting-suite and Complete-me.

## Sorting-Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

For this project I wrote bubble, insertion, merge, and quick sort algorithms. They have a comprehensive test suite that test functionality and the limit to what they can each consistantly sort in less than 2 seconds. The evaluation was a livecode of either merge or quick sort and an explanation of how the not coded algorithm works using cards.

## Complete-Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

For this project I wrote a series of methods that implemented a prefix trie. The trie is able to insert words into its structure, search words, and suggest words based on a prefix. It can also select words and offer words in order of preference and delete words from suggestions. The evaluation was live coding either the insert or suggest function and explaining on a whiteboard how the insertion works node by node.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In mod 2 the group projects were GameTime and Weathrly.

## (GameTime)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For this project I worked with Casey Dallavalle. We made a version of [Winterbells](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm) that we called SpaceHopper because it was set in space. We used the HTML5 canvas element to render a game written in javascript. This project used a lot of object oriented programming and rendering approximations of physics.
