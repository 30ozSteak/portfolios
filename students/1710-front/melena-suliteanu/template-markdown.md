# Melena Suliteanu - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to build the base of knowledge I would need to continue through the program: I was especially excited about learning to use javascript to make things interactive. With soft skills I wanted to learn how to pair effectively.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project was my first: the goal was to make a number guessing game where the user could submit guesses to match a randomly generated number. On win the range is updated to be 10 larger in either direction and the user can also set a preferred range. It is written in JavaScript.

##### Evaluation comments:
  Work on syntax and spacing consistency
  Liked the fun picture injection
  Maybe add comments to CSS for better organization
  Be more verbose and explicit when naming functions and variables

##### Evaluation Scores: 
  ###### Functional Expectations

    Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
    Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.

 #### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/oneStaticComp)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project is the first static composition challenge for Module 1 at Turing. The goal of the project is to recreate the provided layout with the option to change copy, colors, and images; additionally, the site is required to be responsive and all layouts for different screen sizes were designed by me. I made my site a retirement community for milk cows with soft colors and rounded fonts and icons.

 #### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/ms-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This is the second Static Composition challenge in Module 1 for Turing School of Software and Design. The goal is to match the layout of the original comp while creating a site with new copy, fonts, colors, and theme that is still cohesive and appealing. I chose to make my site a spell sharing site for witches. I chose witches because their connectedness to nature and owning of their womanhood really appeals to me. The site is fully responsive. Cards are laid out using CSS Grid.

 #### Static Comp 3d

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/ms-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment]

This project is the final static composition challenge for Module 1 at Turing. The goal of the project is to recreate the provided layout with the option to change copy, colors, and images; additionally, the site is required to be responsive and all layouts for different screen sizes were designed by me. I chose to do my site on the Carpathian Mountain range in Romania. I'm trying to learn Romanian right now so I challenged myself to do the comp in Romanian (it is far from perfect but it was a fun experiment)! There are hover states on every button, all items in the navigation bar on the right, and the page tabs in the header. The site is responsive from very large desktop screens to mobile devices.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

To further build on coding skills while also practicing pairing we had a number of paired projects.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/valentinovtino/mod1-linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project is a bookmarking application for websites. Users can create bookmarks with a title and a link, and delete them. They are not stored. The project is written with jQuery.

##### Evaluation Comments:
  Confusing for user that Enter button is red when disabled - try graying it out instead. Not clear that Delete Read button is      actually a button due to design.
  Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
  Nice use of branches and commit messages on GitHub!
  Be sure indents are the same throughout in HTML file and that things are not double-indented Lines 13-17.
  YAY ARIA - alt, lables/inputs, semantic tags.
  Stick with one unit of measurement in CSS for consistency (em vs px) - stysheet has a mixture of both.
  Add commented code for organization in CSS files.
  JS file is easy to read and functions are single responsibility. No anonymous functions and good naming conventions. Both       could speak to code.

##### Evaluation Scores:
  ###### Functional Expectations

    Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
    Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
