## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to build the base of knowledge I would need to continue through the program: I was especially excited about learning to use javascript to make things interactive. With soft skills I wanted to learn how to pair effectively.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/farmermel/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project was my first: the goal was to make a number guessing game where the user could submit guesses to match a randomly generated number. On win the range is updated to be 10 larger in either direction and the user can also set a preferred range. It is written in JavaScript.

##### Evaluation comments:
  Work on syntax and spacing consistency
  Liked the fun picture injection
  Maybe add comments to CSS for better organization
  Be more verbose and explicit when naming functions and variables

##### Evaluation Scores: 
  ###### Functional Expectations

    Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
    Exceptional: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three and one or more of the extensions.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

To further build on coding skills while also practicing pairing we had a number of paired projects.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/valentinovtino/mod1-linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project is a bookmarking application for websites. Users can create bookmarks with a title and a link, and delete them. They are not stored. The project is written with jQuery.

##### Evaluation Comments:
  Confusing for user that Enter button is red when disabled - try graying it out instead. Not clear that Delete Read button is      actually a button due to design.
  Small fixes for responsiveness across all screen sizes.
  Nice use of branches and commit messages on GitHub!
  Be sure indents are the same throughout in HTML file and that things are not double-indented Lines 13-17.
  YAY ARIA - alt, lables/inputs, semantic tags.
  Stick with one unit of measurement in CSS for consistency (em vs px) - stysheet has a mixture of both.
  Add commented code for organization in CSS files.
  JS file is easy to read and functions are single responsibility. No anonymous functions and good naming conventions. Both       could speak to code.

##### Evaluation Scores:
  ###### Functional Expectations

    Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
    Exceptional: You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.
