## B: Individual Work & Projects

I worked on two individual projects this mod: Swapi box and my personal project Puzzle Swap.

#### Lego Swapi Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/swapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

The goals of this project were to practice React, Router, asynchronous JS, and testing. The landing page has a movie scroll from a random Star Wars movie and buttons for the people, planets, and vehicles of Star Wars and user favorites. Each button leads to a different page via router which displays cards of trivia for that topic. Cards can be favorited and are added to a user's favorites. 
I made this project Lego themed and the whole page can be translated to Shyriiwook (the language of the wookies) for a little extra joy.

#### Puzzle Swap: Personal Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/farmermel/puzzle-swap)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

The goal of this project was to make something I'm excited about that pulls together everything I've learned in Mod 3. 
I chose to make an application for people who love jigsaw puzzles and don't have anything to do with ones they've completed. Someone who is not logged in is able to view all puzzles. A user can sign up or log in to claim or post a puzzle. The post puzzle form takes a title, an image (that can be cropped to a specific aspect ratio), number of pieces, and number of pieces missing. A user can unlist their own puzzles from the main page. To claim a puzzle, user clicks claim on the puzzle itself which starts a message with the owner. They can then message back and forth to come to an agreement about handoff.

This project uses React, Redux, Router, and react-image-crop on the frontend with Firebase realtime database, authentication, and cloud storage for data storage.
