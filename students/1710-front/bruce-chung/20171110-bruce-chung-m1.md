# Bruce Chung - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

I entered the module with very basic javascript knowledge and almost no experience in CSS or HTML. My goal was to learn as much as possible by adhering to tight schedule and trying to stay ahead of the curve.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the results.  I was able to arrive early and review the lesson, pair early and often, and work through projects over the weekend so that most of the week was review.  A point of improvement for next mod is to stay just as disciplined with my workout schedule so that I can remain focused and energetic.
