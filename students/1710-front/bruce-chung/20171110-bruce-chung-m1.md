# Bruce Chung - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

I entered the module with very basic javascript knowledge and almost no experience in CSS or HTML. My goal was to learn as much as possible by adhering to tight schedule and trying to stay ahead of the curve.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the results.  I was able to arrive early and review the lesson, pair early and often, and work through projects over the weekend so that most of the week was review.  A point of improvement for next mod is to stay just as disciplined with my workout schedule so that I can remain focused and energetic.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects included Number Guesser, the first project, and three static compositions that were spread over the last half of the module.  

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/numberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was the first project and it working through it gave me an understanding of DOM manipulation and event listeners.  It was also my first exposure to putting together html, css, and js in one project.  

Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Comments:
 - Insults generator for th3 win! Like that you are pushing yourself to experiment with code outside of the requirements
 - Nice work with ARIA ---> and using the lang attribute in your HTML
 - Be sure to organize CSS and check for any redundancy
 - Works towards single responsibility in your JS functions. Understands scope.
 - Though it technically can be done, best practice is to separate your markup from your JS functionality (i.e. no click     handlers in your HTML)

#### Static Composition 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brucekchung/static-comp1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Static Comp 1 was a good introduction to flexbox.  I learned responsive design and how to use media queries.  

Evaluator Comments:
 - white text is unreadable on yellow background, need more contrast
 - needs better icon and text spacing
 - margins are too tight on collapse, and images and text need to be centered
 - colors do not match image
