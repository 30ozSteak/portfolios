## Areas of Emphasis

This module my main objective was to get a solid fundamental base in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was important for me that everything I learned was of quality, even if that meant that I might not build as many features on some of my projects.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of the last module, we have had four individual projects in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our first individual project, Number Guesser, tested our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, we had 3 static comps that involved more complex HTML and CSS.

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/number-guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our very first project in Module 1 and was done after our first week of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users had to choose a range of numbers to guess from and every round a new random number was generated. I would have liked to build out more features and make it a two player game. 

#### Evaluation Comments
- Comp recreation/design pretty spot on - very minor details with spacing to make it pixel perfect
- Good use of error messaging
- Good organization/indentation in HTML file
- Nice job alphabetizing declarations. Work towards more organization in CSS stylesheet
- Start working towards single responsibility in JS functions
- Speaks confidently about decisions made in code. Understands local vs global scope and what code is doing

### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/at-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For our first static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We weren't given any native files, assets, nor specific breakpoints. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette.

#### Evaluation Comments

- Be careful with yellow and gray, gray text on top of yellow can be difficult to read
- More breathing room with icon and text
- Equalize margin

### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/at-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

For our first static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We weren't given any native files, assets, nor specific breakpoints. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette.

#### Evaluation Comments

- Be careful with using vh, because it will not squish well. Put a fixed px height
- Align login to the right
- Make sure to put an active state on
- More breathing room with icon and text
- Maybe could put a soft shadow on "views" so that it is more visible on darker backgrounds
- Make icon and text change togeter in hover state
- Break layout sooner for 3 cards across
- Make the space between cards a fixed width
- Put more space between login and heading
- Set the margin and padding in px

### Static Comp Challenge 3 

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/soytjan/at-comp-challenge-3)
* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/at-comp-challenge-3/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Our task was to recreate a given comp using only HTML and CSS. We were not provided with any assets, nor native files. We had creative license to change the copy, images, icons, and color palette. We were required to make a basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css. The site also had to be responsive. 

#### Evaluation Comments
- The icons at the top could have been a little wider and taller so they werenâ€™t so smushed at the top
- Social media buttons could have been a little taller
- More spacing between links on sidebar nav

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Over the course of the last 6 weeks, we had a total of 3 paired projects. All of the projects tested our HTML and CSS abilities, as well as building on our JavaScript and jQuery abilities week by week. I did Linked Lists with Kailin Cannon, IdeaBox with Melissa Wagasky, and 2DoBox-Pivot with Michelle Hoffman. 

### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This was our first project with jQuery. We had to build out an app that had two input fields, where a user could add in the title and URL of a bookmark. The created bookmarks were then appended to a created bookmark section of the page. In this project, we first learned about event bubbling and manipulating the DOM using jQuery. 

#### Evaluation Comments
- nice UI! just a little tweaking for the counter and the "delete read" button. overall nice layout additions.
- remember that paired projects are as much about compromise and flexibility as they are about getting the work done.
- well formatted code.
- Codebase is in a good place to do a refactor pass -- nice work!

#### Feedback from Kailin
Overall I'd say our project did very well! You're great with your attention to detail. Even with the initial pass of CSS the site was already quite responsive & I wasn't anxious about that part of the project at all. I appreciate you setting up the pairings & thank you for being flexible with our schedules. I think we paced it really well. Despite our personality differences, I never thought it affected our work progress/efficiency which I think is really important. I know I got snappish with you a few times, which is my fault & I apologize. All I'd ask for in the future is a little more patience. There were times where I was in the middle of trying to get an explanation from someone for whatever I was working on, and you would come up and ask about what was going on. In retrospect, maybe you were just trying to dive in & offer help, but at the time it felt like you wanted me to drop the conversation I was having to explain everything right then. I think it would have been better if you had waited until I was done with the conversation, and then I could've immediately come to you afterward to explain. But I really do appreciate how hard you worked on the CSS making everything look pretty and responsive & thank you for helping me that Monday with that large chunk of jQuery that I'd been stuck on.
