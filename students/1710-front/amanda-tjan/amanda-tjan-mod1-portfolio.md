# Amanda Tjan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module my main objective was to get a solid fundamental base in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was important for me that everything I learned was of quality, even if that meant that I might not build as many features on some of my projects.

Number Guesser was our very first project in Module 1 and was done after our first week of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a game where users have to guess a number between a range of numbers of their choosing.
