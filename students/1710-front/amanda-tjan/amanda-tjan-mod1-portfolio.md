# Amanda Tjan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module my main objective was to get a solid fundamental base in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was important for me that everything I learned was of quality, even if that meant that I might not build as many features on some of my projects.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our very first project in Module 1 and was done after our first week of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a game where users have to guess a number between a range of numbers of their choosing. 

#### Evaluation Comments
- Comp recreation/design pretty spot on - very minor details with spacing to make it pixel perfect
- Good use of error messaging
- Good organization/indentation in HTML file
- Nice job alphabetizing declarations. Work towards more organization in CSS stylesheet

### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/at-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For our first static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We weren't given any native files, assets, nor specific breakpoints. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette.

### Static Comp Challenge 2

### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/at-comp-challenge-3/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Our task was to recreate a given comp using only HTML and CSS. We were not provided with any assets, nor native files. We had creative license to change the copy, images, icons, and color palette. We needed to make a basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css. The site had to be responsive and we had to use a normalize instead of reset file in CSS. The site had to work across Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

### Static Comp Challenge 3
