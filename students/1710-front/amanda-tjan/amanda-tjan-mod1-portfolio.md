# Amanda Tjan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module my main objective was to get a solid fundamental base in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was important for me that everything I learned was of quality, even if that meant that I might not build as many features on some of my projects.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of the last module, we have had four individual projects in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our first individual project, Number Guesser, tested our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, we had 3 static comps that involved more complex HTML and CSS.

### Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our very first project in Module 1 and was done after our first week of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users had to choose a range of numbers to guess from and every round a new random number was generated. I would have liked to build out more features and make it a two player game. 

#### Evaluation Comments
- Comp recreation/design pretty spot on - very minor details with spacing to make it pixel perfect
- Good use of error messaging
- Good organization/indentation in HTML file
- Nice job alphabetizing declarations. Work towards more organization in CSS stylesheet
- Start working towards single responsibility in JS functions
- Speaks confidently about decisions made in code. Understands local vs global scope and what code is doing

* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/at-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For our first static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We weren't given any native files, assets, nor specific breakpoints. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette.

#### Evaluation Comments

- Be careful with yellow and gray, gray text on top of yellow can be difficult to read
- More breathing room with icon and text
- Equalize margin

### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/at-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

For our first static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We weren't given any native files, assets, nor specific breakpoints. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette.

#### Evaluation Comments

- Be careful with using vh, because it will not squish well. Put a fixed px height
- Align login to the right
- Make sure to put an active state on
- More breathing room with icon and text
- Maybe could put a soft shadow on "views" so that it is more visible on darker backgrounds
- Make icon and text change togeter in hover state
- Break layout sooner for 3 cards across
- Make the space between cards a fixed width
- Put more space between login and heading
- Set the margin and padding in px

### Static Comp Challenge 3 

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/soytjan/at-comp-challenge-3)
* [GitHub Pages](https://soytjan.github.io/at-comp-challenge-3/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

Our task was to recreate a given comp using only HTML and CSS. We were not provided with any assets, nor native files. We had creative license to change the copy, images, icons, and color palette. We were required to make a basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css. The site also had to be responsive. 

#### Evaluation Comments
- The icons at the top could have been a little wider and taller so they weren’t so smushed at the top
- Social media buttons could have been a little taller
- More spacing between links on sidebar nav

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Over the course of the last 6 weeks, we had a total of 3 paired projects. All of the projects tested our HTML and CSS abilities, as well as building on our JavaScript and jQuery abilities week by week. I did Linked Lists with Kailin Cannon, IdeaBox with Melissa Wagasky, and 2DoBox-Pivot with Michelle Hoffman. 

### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kc2693/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This was our first project with jQuery. We had to build out an app that had two input fields, where a user could add in the title and URL of a bookmark. The created bookmarks were then appended to a created bookmark section of the page. In this project, we first learned about event bubbling and manipulating the DOM using jQuery. 

#### Evaluation Comments
- nice UI! just a little tweaking for the counter and the "delete read" button. overall nice layout additions.
- remember that paired projects are as much about compromise and flexibility as they are about getting the work done.
- well formatted code.
- Codebase is in a good place to do a refactor pass -- nice work!

#### Feedback from Kailin
Overall I'd say our project did very well! You're great with your attention to detail. Even with the initial pass of CSS the site was already quite responsive & I wasn't anxious about that part of the project at all. I appreciate you setting up the pairings & thank you for being flexible with our schedules. I think we paced it really well. Despite our personality differences, I never thought it affected our work progress/efficiency which I think is really important. I know I got snappish with you a few times, which is my fault & I apologize. All I'd ask for in the future is a little more patience. There were times where I was in the middle of trying to get an explanation from someone for whatever I was working on, and you would come up and ask about what was going on. In retrospect, maybe you were just trying to dive in & offer help, but at the time it felt like you wanted me to drop the conversation I was having to explain everything right then. I think it would have been better if you had waited until I was done with the conversation, and then I could've immediately come to you afterward to explain. But I really do appreciate how hard you worked on the CSS making everything look pretty and responsive & thank you for helping me that Monday with that large chunk of jQuery that I'd been stuck on.

#### Evaluation Comments -- Evaluated by Pam
- Majority of functionality met! No error handling - can create blank cards with no title and/or body.
- Good naming and convetions followed for Git/Github. And YAY for using Waffle to stay on top of issues!
- Design stays very true to comp
- Good organization of CSS file
- Remove unnecessary spacing in HTML file. Hooray for ARIA - continue to push forward. Add lang attribute to HTML
- Areas for refactoring: event listeners to reference named functions instead of anonymous functions. Change for loop in lines 123 and 190 to array prototypes. Some redundancy between editCardTitle and EditCardDescription that could be refactored. Unclear why quality is set up as a parameter in your constructor as it's never passed in as an argument.

#### Evaluation Scores
##### Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

#### HTML

##### Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

##### Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

#### CSS

##### Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

##### Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

#### JAVASCRIPT

##### Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

##### Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

##### Functions & Scope

* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

##### Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.


##### Objects & Prototypes

* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

##### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

##### Style

* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.


#### GIT & GITHUB

##### Git

* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

##### GitHub

* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

#### DESIGN

##### Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
* Exceptional Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.


#### PAIRING

##### Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.
* Exceptional Pair collaboration and communication is exceptional, with the distribution of work being equal and balanced, and both partners experiencing a good working flow, able to handle stress, deadlines, issues with calm and focused demeanor.
