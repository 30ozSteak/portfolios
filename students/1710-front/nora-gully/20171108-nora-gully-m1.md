# Nora Gully - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into Turing not having done any coding before, so I think that for a complete beginner, I did great. I have a background in creative applications and design so I was most comfortable with HTML/CSS. Learning Javascript was my greatest challenge and I think I came a long way. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

## A: End of Module Assessment

I don't know the final scores yet, but I think that I passed. 

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During Mod 1 at Turing, my required individual projects were *Number Guesser* and *Static Comps 1-3*. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

For our first project, we made a game where you guess numbers. This was my first foray into DOM manipulation and my Javascript was definitely at a beginner level. I struggled with this assignment but fulfilled all the requirements. Also I had fun adding rainbow unicorns when you win the game. 

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**Evaluation Comments**
- break out single responsibility functions
- JS is in a good place for a refactor pass
- overall, make sure you're mindful of small details like spacing, indentation, and DRY code.
- it is great that you're comfortable trying things out and experimenting. Make sure you give yourself a little time to tidy things up and really understand how all the parts work together, too.
- yay unicorns!

**Evaluation Scores**
- Functional Expectations: Advanced Beginner/Proficient
- Comp Recreation/Design: Advanced Beginner
- HTML: Advanced Beginner
- CSS: Advanced Beginner
- JS/JQ: Advanced Beginner
- Surprise and Delight: Unicorn Rainbows

#### Static Comp 1

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

For our first comp recreation assignment, I chose a theme of 'robot takeover'. The assignment involved creating a web layout that is responsive in mobile using Flexbox. I struggled using Flexbox for the first time, but I think that overall my choice of color, fonts, icons and sizes were sound. I chose a different mobile solution than a lot of students but I think it worked well. I ran out of time to fix some things but learned a lot.

**Evaluation Comments**
- some squirelliness!
- nice color palette

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/ng-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

Our second comp critique was scheduled the day of Halloween 2017, so I knew that I would be dressed as Medusa (fitting with our class theme of Mythical Creatures). As a tie-in, I decided to make my static comp about Medusa's victims - the people she 'stoned'. I had a lot of fun with it. I also felt way more comfortable with Flexbox and the transition from desktop to mobile layouts. 

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**Evaluation Comments**
- you're funny! 
- overall nice color choices
- make sure things are centered when you switch to mobile
- red on gray is a dicey choice
- not enough contrast with text on photos

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nogully/ng-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

For our third static comp assignment, I tried my best to recreate the assignment based on the original design. I did switch out some of the copy and photos with the world-famous Doge, but otherwise I stuck to the corporate theme because the copy and purpose of the website were somewhat unintelligible. 

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**Evaluation Comments**
- you're funny! 
- overall nice job
- watch your margins, some fine-tuning
- don't name elements after their tag, it's redundant
- bring back the circles! 
- could use more color, like on hover states
- some squirrelliness in your media queries, transition from desktop to tablet should happen sooner

*Feedback from Bruce: Enjoyed working with you! We improved and learned a lot on GitHub as a pair.  I think we had a good workflow and communicated well and the project went very smoothly.  I was relieved to have you work on the CSS with me.  I think it would be helpful to keep asking your partner questions when you get stuck so the two of you can work through problems together.  Good work and keep it up!*
