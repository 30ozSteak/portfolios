# Niraj Aryal - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This mod my main goal was to understand how javascript works. I was able to get introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript which was super interesting to me. I tried my best to grasp all the knowledge that was given to me in Mod 1 but I am still feeling shaky on many areas.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I failed big time on end of Module Assessment. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects I did during Mod 1 was Static comp1, Static comp2 and fotofinder. 

#### Static comp 1

* [Github Url](https://github.com/niroz11/na-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

(The goal of this project was to re-create the comp that was given to us. This site can be improved in so many areas including responsiveness and code refactoring)

#### Static comp 2

* [Github Url](https://github.com/niroz11/static-comp2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

(The goal of this project was to re-enforce the concepts that we got during static comp2. I was able to understand more about applying HTML and CSS knowledge and using media query. This comp is still not perfect and still there are many areas that I can work on.)

#### fotofinder

* [Github Url](https://github.com/niroz11/foto-finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

(The goal of this project was to dive into deeper concepts on DOM manipulation and Javascript. It was definetely more complex than number guesser and IdeaBox but I had fun working on this project. )

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Number Guesser was the first project we did in Mod 1 which introduced us to Javascript and DOM manipulation.)

#### Number Guesser doubles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/niroz11/number_guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

Number Guesser is a two player game where a random number is generated and two players have to guess the right answer. It also calculates how much time was taken to take the right guess and winner is displayed as soon as they guess the right answer.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/niroz11/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

IdeaBox was a complex project that we did for a group project. It was definelty the most challenging project we had in Mod 1. There were a lot of issues working in a group but we got a lot of things that I ever expected. 



## D: Community Participation

### Attended demo night

I participated in community works by participating in demo night and supported developers that came out of Turing.
