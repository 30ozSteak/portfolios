# Gabriel Inzurriaga - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I aimed to have a basic understanding of javascript to the point where I can make a simple application. I also wanted to greatly increase upon my knowledge of CSS so I create larger front end display and cleaner CSS with ease. I also learn some new habits for not only making my code easier for me to read but also for others and be more business-friendly.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I feel I learn a lot while being at turning. I went from not knowing how to use javascript, the terminal, or even knowing that GitHub was more than just a name used for a website to actually creating something that works. I can use the terminal with ease and know how to read the errors so I know where the problems are created. I know all the basic with GitHub to where I can be efficient in group projects. finally, I feel I know the basics of javascript to where I can create something simple without referring back to notes or google.

the comment I had with my Fotofinder was to clean up my javascript and to not over-engineer my functions.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

these are the projects from first to last that I work on with other turing students

We were able to build out a site that allows two players to play. select their own range. clear each game, and reset the entire game. below is an image of our project.

number guesser needed some fixes to make it a better user experience and the javascript wasn't as clean as it should.

The overall score I receive for the project was Advanced Beginner.

there was just small mistake just as use a different tag for HTML, use more id's, and a different way to write a function in javascript to make it more simple.

half the score was Proficient and the other half was Exceptional.
