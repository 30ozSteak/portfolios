# Tom Wilhoit - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I had two major goals during this module; to develop learning skills in a non-military environment and to learn the foundations of web development. 

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2.5
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe that the End of Module Assessment did not go perfectly. Nerves and inexperience left the impression that I was not as skilled as I believe myself to be. Functions that were muscle memory in practice did not come as easily as usual, and I truly feel I have a grasp of the materials. While the instructor had concerns, I do not believe it should keep me from progressing.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### FotoFinder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TomWilhoit/FotoFinder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

Create an Instagram-esque clone that saves, deletes, edits, sorts, and favorites pictures in both desktop and mobile view.

Comments: TBD

Score: TBD

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TomWilhoit/number_guesser_doubles/blob/master/README.md)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk1.html)

Create a number guessing game with two name-editable players and score cards using local memory. 

Evaluation Comments: 

    Nice work with creating clearer commits
        Continue to work on creating more commits
        Create more branches each time you're working on a new feature
        DON'T PUSH UP TO MASTER!
    Nice work pairing up and collaboration. Playing off each other's strengths.
    Might give some notification that a new game has started after winning.
    Nice error handling and handling multiple user inputs.
    Continue to work on spacing both in desktop and mobile views
        Buttons get a bit squished
        Title could be down a bit and centered vertically
        Center inputs in mobile view
    Might use reset.css or normalize.css for next project for cross browser compatibility
    Careful of using too many div tags (try using more semantic HTML)
        Use p or button tags instead of divs
    Careful of using camelCase on classes
    I would stick with only forms, inputs, and buttons having IDs
    Continue to work on formatting of HTML and style things according to the styleguide.
    Continue to work on structure of styles and alphabetizing properties
    Be careful of using vh and stick more with pixels or percentages(practice squishing window vertically)
    Clean up commented out lines of code
    Make sure styles follow CSS styleguide (tabbed in correctly)
    When you start to use more classes, hopefully you won't need to use so many styles for ids. Reuse classes in overlap.
    Continue to clear up commented out lines in Javascript
    Don't need the window.onload for the global variables and class
    Clear up console.logs as well
    Grab elements in variables instead of returning them in functions.
        Grab value in event listeners.
    Be consistent using function declarations in event listeners
    To give HTML inputs a default disabled state, add it to the HTML instead of the Javascript
    Nice work with some functions having SRP focus
        Continue to work on this


Evaluation Scores:

Functional Expectations :Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished but shows attention to detail.

COMP RECREATION / DESIGN: Advanced Beginner

HTML: Advanced Beginner

CSS: Novice

JS: Advanced Beginner

Surprise and Delight: Hot Fire

### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

Create an editable card-based storage system for ideas. Cards can change in quality value, be sorted, edited, and can be saved in local storage.

Evaluation Comments:

HTML: Good use of semantic elements
      Clean HTML stylistically

CSS: Consider leveraging more relative units particularly for widths
     Consider using organizational comments and alphabetizing within rules so that you're able to find things more easily

JS: You all seem to have a good understanding of what's going on in the codebase, which is great.
    DRY it up. Whenever there are 3 lines shared between functions, that should be its own function
    Be sure to use your debugging tools as you go. Line by line.

Evaluation Scores: 

Functional Expectations: Novice - Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, and
                                  those changes persist in localStorage
                         Advanced Beginner - Application adds 'Changing the quality of an idea' and enables 'Filtering and
                                  Searching by Text' as defined in the spec

Comp Recreation: Advanced Beginner - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and
                 mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment, etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth

HTML: Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

CSS: Novice - Crafts CSS according to the turing css style guide

JAVASCRIPT: Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the Idea class
            including all required methods




## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My role at Turing was social glue. I kept everyone included, kept spirits high, and refused to let motivation in 1810FE falter. People skills are my strongest areas, regardless of the activity. Fostering relationships, supporting difficult events, and knitting a sense of community is my role not just at Turing, but every room I step into.
