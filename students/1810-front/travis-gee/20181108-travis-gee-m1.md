##### Evaluation comments

* Nice work with commits and getting better with commit messages.
  * Continue to work on branches and branch names.
* Really good attention to UI and UX 
  * Handled multiple situations with input and user error
* Very good mobile view
  * Some buttons and text git a but squished on some views (might add a little additional spacing)
  * Buttons get very long and thin on tablet view.  Might think of ways to make them a bit shorter with a fixed width and a bit taller at certain break points
* Nice animation for the winner and good use of the timer
* Might use normalize.css or reset.css file in beginning to normalize across browsers
* Nice work reusing classes.  
* Don't need action on form since you are using event.preventDefault()
* Use styles for bolding fonts instead of using strong if you are not trying to add extra emphasis on text
* Might create more of a hierarchy using h3 or h4 tags instead of multiple p tags
* Also I would try to stay away from nested divs.  Try to find ways to clean up HTML structure and use sections or articles instead
* Great work organizing styles and alphabetizing properties
* Great work organizing properties alphabetically
* I really like the select function so you don't have to write all the querySelectors.  Very creative
* When removing cards, using event.target to delete the element.  If you need to move up the DOM tree, try using parentNode.
* Checking to see if the text is BOOM before creating a new card seems like additional logic.
  * You have already done this logic when you checked if the answer is correct or not.
* Might find ways to organize functions by error handling, etc instead of alphabetically

##### Evaluation comments

###### html
* Use forms!
* Consider adding js- before classNames that are only used in js

###### css
* rocked it

###### js
* Loved the process
* Consider refactoring all of the various calls to local storage to be one call
  that stores all ideas in an array
* Consider refactoring quality data model to be integer based - only worry about
  the text when we display it.
  
##### Evaluation scores
* [Idea Box Evaluations Github](https://github.com/geet084/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1810/mod-1/idea-box/travis-eric.md)

* Functional Expectations
  *  Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec
* Comp Recreation
  *  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward
* HTML - Style and Implementation
  *  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by using appropriate semantic elements and using `data-*` attributes for all data related things
* CSS - Style and Implementation
  *  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle
* JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation
  *  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
