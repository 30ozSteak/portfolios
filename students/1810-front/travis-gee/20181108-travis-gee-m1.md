## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/geet084/tg-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

We were tasked with re-creating a website based on a provided composition

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/geet084/tg-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

We were tasked with re-creating a website based on a provided composition

#### Foto Finder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/geet084/foto-finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

For this project I created an app that allows the user to add photos to the page with titles and captions. This project implemented local storage so that all of the photo cards persisted on the page after reloading. Once they upload them the user can then favorite them, edit the existing captions or delete them from the page.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment Week 1](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk1.html)
* [Original Assignment Week 2](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

For this project we created a number guessing game where the user is challanged to correctly guess a randomly generated number. The user can add their own range and then the application will generate a random number between those minimum and maximum inputs. If the user guesses correctly, the game will tell them 'BOOM!' and then the minimum range decreases by 10 and the maximum range increases by 10.

##### Evaluation comments

* Nice work with commits and getting better with commit messages.
  * Continue to work on branches and branch names.
* Really good attention to UI and UX 
  * Handled multiple situations with input and user error
* Very good mobile view
  * Some buttons and text git a but squished on some views (might add a little additional spacing)
  * Buttons get very long and thin on tablet view.  Might think of ways to make them a bit shorter with a fixed width and a bit taller at certain break points
* Nice animation for the winner and good use of the timer
* Might use normalize.css or reset.css file in beginning to normalize across browsers
* Nice work reusing classes.  
* Don't need action on form since you are using event.preventDefault()
* Use styles for bolding fonts instead of using strong if you are not trying to add extra emphasis on text
* Might create more of a hierarchy using h3 or h4 tags instead of multiple p tags
* Also I would try to stay away from nested divs.  Try to find ways to clean up HTML structure and use sections or articles instead
* Great work organizing styles and alphabetizing properties
* Great work organizing properties alphabetically
* I really like the select function so you don't have to write all the querySelectors.  Very creative
* When removing cards, using event.target to delete the element.  If you need to move up the DOM tree, try using parentNode.
* Checking to see if the text is BOOM before creating a new card seems like additional logic.
  * You have already done this logic when you checked if the answer is correct or not.
* Might find ways to organize functions by error handling, etc instead of alphabetically

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ericweissman/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)


For this project we created an app that allowed you to add all of your ideas via cards to the page. This project implemented local storage so that all of your ideas persisted on the page after reloading. You can delete your ideas, search through them, edit them, and upvote or downvote the quality of each idea.

##### Evaluation comments

###### html
* Use forms!
* Consider adding js- before classNames that are only used in js

###### css
* rocked it

###### js
* Loved the process
* Consider refactoring all of the various calls to local storage to be one call
  that stores all ideas in an array
* Consider refactoring quality data model to be integer based - only worry about
  the text when we display it.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did not participate as much in the overall community as much as I probably should have. I have gone to Brothers a few times, and a couple of the larger Turing events as well. Overall I think most of my contribution was more local to the cohort where I have been able to help others with their projects and learning.
