-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I truly don't know. I have areas that I feel I don't know backwards and forwards. I would like to work more on Modules as well as Advanced Enumerables.




## B: Individual Work & Projects

This has been night and day from the start until week six. On credit check, I felt overwhelmed and lost. During Battleship, at times I felt overwhelmed, but knew this would pass. From a technical perspective, my skills improved drastically. My ability to timebox improved, but not to the levels I would like (ie area of improvement). With Battleship, I certainly didn't know all the answers, but I knew how to incrementally build and find the answers.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

  I very much enjoyed the group work and, especially, the projects. Having a second person with a different perspective and strengths helped not only create a unique and better project, but it also served as an incredible learning opportunity for myself. The quality of my understanding and ability to contribute drastically increased between our two group projects.

#### (Night Writer)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mdevoe12/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

Description:
  Using File I/O, write a program that converts an English message into "Braille" and write to a txt. Then read the Braille file, convert and write the English back to a txt.

Evaluation Comments:
  Application translates english to braille.
  Would like to have seen more testing - Every class should have its own test, every method should have at least one corresponding test at minimum.
  IN the future, depend less on instance variables to do your information sharing for you - methods should be sending and recieving messages.

  Evaluation Scores:
    1. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
    2. Test-Driven Development: 1
    3. Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 2
    4. Functional Expectations: 2

Feedback to me from Mike Heft:
  Hey Matt, it was great working with you on Night Writer. This feedback is a little difficult for me to write as we pretty much gave each other feedback the entire time we worked together. I think we communicated very well with each other in terms of work load and direction we wanted to go. I feel both of us were really good about allowing the other free reign to run with ideas on issues.  And we eventually would mutually decide that might be the wrong rabbit hole to go down. The only thing I would say that both of us need to work on is better communication of our personal needs. We spent long hours together and the one time when we stopped earlier than we had intended was because both of us were spent. We talked about this in our retro with each other, but I know for me personally I need to work on being more assertive about what I need, especially in terms of rest and/or breaks. On the topic of breaks, you were great at implementing them. I know we didn't utilize them much, but when we did we ended getting more work done than when we hadn't. I had a great time working with you, and hopefully we'll have the chance for future collaborations in later mods.

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

  From a larger community level, I attended class every day save one due to an unforeseen medical issue. I was here early and I left late. I spent nearly every Saturday and Sunday here. I participated in every spike, several of the guest speakers and took advantage of the mentors.

  While here, I truly tried to be a positive influence and an aid to others during Mod 1. I am/was not the strongest student. However, I tried to be a helping hand to anyone else struggling with an issue, code-based or otherwise.

  Additionally, every day I bring with me a plush football. We use this as a fun distraction for those working late. It gives us a mental break and helps build a bit of camaraderie.
