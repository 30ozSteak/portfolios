# Matt DeVoe - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

My beginning goal was to work as hard as possible on learning Ruby and beginner back-end fundamentals. I've learned way more than what I expected to learn. While I didn't expect coding to be the only emphasis, I learned way more than just "coding".

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

* **E: Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I truly don't know.  In some cases, I feel comfortable with the material and believe that I know more than I think I do. However, I still find myself struggling with proper vocabulary part of the time. Additionally, there are areas that I feel I don't know backwards and forwards. For example, I would like to work more on Modules, Advanced Enumerables and refactoring old projects.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

There has been a drastic change between my first and final solo project. On credit check, I felt overwhelmed and lost. During Battleship, at times I felt overwhelmed, but knew this would pass. From a technical perspective, my skills improved drastically. My ability to time box improved, but not to the levels I would like (this is an area of improvement). With Battleship, I certainly didn't know all the answers, but I knew how to incrementally build what I needed and find the answers.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

  I very much enjoyed the group work and, especially, the projects. Having a second person with different perspectives and strengths helped not only create unique and better project, but it also served as an incredible learning opportunity. The quality of understanding and ability to contribute drastically increased between the two group projects.

* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer)

  Using File I/O, write a program that converts an English message into "Braille" and write to a txt. Then read the Braille file, convert and write the English back to a txt.

Evaluation Comments:
  Application translates english to braille.
  Would like to have seen more testing - Every class should have its own test, every method should have at least one corresponding test at minimum.
  IN the future, depend less on instance variables to do your information sharing for you - methods should be sending and recieving messages.

  Evaluation Scores:
    1. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
    2. Test-Driven Development: 1
    3. Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 2
    4. Functional Expectations: 2

Evaluation Comments:
  None yet.

Evaluation Scores:
  None yet.



## D: Professional Skills

  Overall, I found the professional skills development sessions useful. The StrengthsFinder Assessment is informative in providing deeper personal context and understanding to how I approach not only work, but the world in general.

  If I'm honest, the original sessions regarding personal branding and story telling were a little lost on me at first. However, our latest session detailing the application of these stories and ideas into the real world shed new light on the importance of this exercise and how this will affect our potential careers in (hopefully) a few months.

  On a separate note, I previously read and applied "Thanks for the Feedback" for an unrelated business course. It's refreshing to see the principles applied and reinforced throughout the program as I previously found the book hit the feedback nail on the head.

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### (Growth Mindset)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

  "Not yet..." This is the proper headspace to inhabit. At Turing, we're dealing with complex, unfamiliar and often abstract concepts/problems. These things don't come naturally to 99.9% of the population. It takes work, discipline and an open mind to improve. The reason I/we are not good at a thing is not due to innate ability, it's time and energy spent on said thing. I'm trying to stay conscientious of my particular triggers and when I move away from a Growth Mindset. So far, I haven't descended too far into a downward spiral, hopefully this stays true.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

  Each of us has a limited tank of cognitive resources. To paraphrase from Kathy Sierra, we suffer from death by a thousand cognitive leaks. The little things that we haven't mastered, but require effort, tax our cognitive resources. There are several ways to decrease/improve our cognitive resources. This includes moving skills from the A category (Can't, but need to do) to the C category (Mastered). Additionally, there are a number of other ways to alleviate cognitive load, including proper lifestyle factors, practicing skills in the "B" category and knowing when to ask for help.

#### (Working Styles: Intro, extro, ambiverts!)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

  Unfortunately, I couldn't attend this session. I left late-morning on 5/19 due to a concussion. In reviewing the material, it looks as if I'm an ambivert. I'm happy to communicate and work in an extroverted style with others. However, I very much enjoy working alone at times as well. This can cary project-to-project and day-by-day.

#### (Personal Stories & Connection)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_4_personal_story.markdown)

  This was a really interesting session. Not only did this help set the stage for future personal branding, but I got to hear others' stories, thoughts and motivations. This session ignited a personal retrospective. The journey to get into Turing was a whirlwind. It took a good amount of reflection and quiet time to really grasp why I'm here and what I value (learning, the desire to build and contribute, the love of technology, etc.)

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

  This is such a sensitive topic. It's difficult to deliver feedback on a topic that I don't have, nor could I have any first hand knowledge about. The sexism, discrimination and inherent bias against women (and other groups) exists. The question is how to drive progress forward in the tech community but also address the cause in addition to the symptoms. Cultural conditioning plays a heavy role. But so do the cultures of the tech world at large. The gender gap is now so widely recognized that it's become a punchline. Like most changes, it starts at the individual/grass roots level. Notice when there may be biased behavior. Call it out.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

  From a larger community level, I attended class every day save one due to an unforeseen medical issue. I was here early and I left late. I spent nearly every Saturday and Sunday here. I participated in every spike, several of the guest speakers and took advantage of the mentors.

  While here, I truly tried to be a positive influence and an aid to others during Mod 1. I am/was not the strongest student. However, I tried to be a helping hand to anyone else struggling with an issue, code-based or otherwise.

  Additionally, every day I bring with me a plush football. We use this as a fun distraction for those working late. It gives us a mental break and helps build a bit of camaraderie.
