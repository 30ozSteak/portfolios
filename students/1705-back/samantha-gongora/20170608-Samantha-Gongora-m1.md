# Samantha Gongora - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Having beginner experience in Ruby, I set out to learn as much as possible about test driven development, business tools (git, github, slack, etc.), pair-programming, and debugging. Starting out in mod 1, testing was painful. I have noticed a significant reduction in pain while testing in my current work. I would venture to say it's becoming enjoyable. I strongly believe the skills I have learned related to pair-programming and debugging will be invaluable during my career at Turing and elsewhere. Looking back on where I was 6 weeks ago, I am proud of how much I have learned and the effort I have put into the program.

#TODO (description)

evaluation comments:
   * 25 tests, all passing
   * completed up to min
   * good recursive approach
   * very thorough testing

evaluation scores:
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
   * 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2. Test-Driven Development
   * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
   * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Functional Expectations
   * 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/samanthagongora/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module1/projects/battleship.markdown)

#TODO (description)

evaluation comments:
   * Very well tested
   * Only single board class which is awesome, written super good.
   * Some small opportunities to refactor, check your indentations as a guide to where to pull out new methods.

evaluation scores:
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
   * 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
2. Enumerable & Collections
   * 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques
3. Test-Driven Development
   * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
4. Git Workflow
   * FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.
4. REPL Interface
   * 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
5. Breaking Logic into Components
   * 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty
6. Functional Expectations
   * 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During Module 1, I served as a Student Advisory Board (SAB) Representative. I attended all Thursday SAB meetings and co-lead Friday retros. Feedback received from retros were brought up during SAB meetings to solicit suggestions for improving culture. A few suggestions Jim and I were able to incorporate:
   * Talking about curriculum concerns to recognize commonality among cohort members, but also encourage survey feedback
   * Mention at least one positive thing for the week, related to anything
   * Implementing shout-out opportunities for behavior we want to celebrate
