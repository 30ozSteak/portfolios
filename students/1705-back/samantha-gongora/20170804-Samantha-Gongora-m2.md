## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

  * Git Workflow
  * Pair programming in conjunction with working remotely
  * Building visual representations of data
  * Digging deeper into best practices
  * Asking Mike more questions during evaluations/check-ins

## Areas of Growth

  * What did you struggle with most this module?
  * What areas did you grow in most this module?
    * I was able to get much more comfortable with Git. I am comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. This allowed me to spend much more time remote, which cut down on the time I spent commuting from Boulder.
    * I made a point to formulate and write down questions before project check-ins. This helped me have more effective meetings and polished code.
    * After the Battleship project in Module 1, I was very excited to build applications that users could interact with. I had the most fun with the analytical dashboards!

## C: Final Assessments
* How did you do on written and timed independent?
  * I think I did very well on the code and written assessments. I struggled more that I would have liked on the average salary method on the code assessment. I wanted to spend more time refactoring and testing the models. I remembered a lot more than I expected on the written portion. I felt the repetition throughout the mod significantly prepared me.

* Was this a representation of your best work?
  * Yes!
