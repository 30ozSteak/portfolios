# Samantha Gongora - M2 Portfolio
-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

## Areas of Emphasis

  * Git Workflow
  * Pair programming in conjunction with working remotely
  * Building visual representations of data
  * Digging deeper into best practices
  * Asking Mike more questions during evaluations/check-ins

## Areas of Growth

  * What did you struggle with most this module?
  * What areas did you grow in most this module?
    * I was able to get much more comfortable with Git. I am comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. This allowed me to spend much more time remote, which cut down on the time I spent commuting from Boulder.
    * I made a point to formulate and write down questions before project check-ins. This helped me have more effective meetings and polished code.
    * After the Battleship project in Module 1, I was very excited to build applications that users could interact with. I had the most fun with the analytical dashboards!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Some crazy things happened, project-wise, in mod 2. From building a *real* application in our first group project, to breathing life to a personal concept, and finally creating a shop with authentication, authorization, and sessions! Dive into my journey:

#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bretfunk/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

Description:
  * Use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco. Collect data in two ways: 1) through web forms, and 2) by consuming CSV files. Provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

Goals:
  * Get comfortable with Bootstrap
  * Learn more about ActiveRecord associations and requests

## C: Final Assessments
  * How did you do on written and timed independent?
    * I think I did very well on the code and written assessments. I struggled more that I would have liked on the average salary method on the code assessment. I wanted to spend more time refactoring and testing the models. I remembered a lot more than I expected on the written portion. I felt the repetition throughout the mod significantly prepared me.

  * Was this a representation of your best work?
    * Yes!
