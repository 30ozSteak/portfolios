1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Looping or Recursion

4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

5. Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
