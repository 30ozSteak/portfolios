## A: Personal Growth
## Areas of Emphasis
I set out this module to bolster my programming habits as well as develope several new ones. Ruby on rails felt like the big focus for this mod, so I hoped that by the end of the module I would feel very comfortable in that enviroment. Another focus of mine going into this module was HTML and css. I wanted to become proficient in front-end styling to compliment the back-end rails work.
