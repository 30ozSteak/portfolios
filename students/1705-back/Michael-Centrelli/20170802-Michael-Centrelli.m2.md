## A: Personal Growth
## Areas of Emphasis
I set out this module to bolster my programming habits as well as develope several new ones. Ruby on rails felt like the big focus for this mod, so I hoped that by the end of the module I would feel very comfortable in that enviroment. Another focus of mine going into this module was HTML and css. I wanted to become proficient in front-end styling to compliment the back-end rails work. 

## Areas of Growth
I think the thing I struggled with most this module was the more complex active record queries. When we first learned them I didn't take to their concepts as quick as I would have liked. I felt shaky on them going into little-shop, but used that project as an oppertunity to increase my understanding. 

I think my biggest growth area this module was TDD. At the end of Mod 1 I wasnt totally comfortable writing my programs with pure TDD. I relied a fair bit on dream development and on my knowledge of where I should look next. This module I made it a priority to follow TDD conventions. And now I feel very comfortable building a test first and following my errors and allowing those errors to take me to the solutions.
