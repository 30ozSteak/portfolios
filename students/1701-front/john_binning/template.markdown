# (John Binning) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for the module was to get as comfortable as possible with the fundamentals of front-end development.  More specifically, I wanted to have a working knowledge of some basic CSS properties and how I can use them, to be comfortable manipulating the DOM with Javascript, and to be able to create clean semantic markdown without difficulty.  Beyond just learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, I wanted to get oriented with the developer community.  That involves investing in relationships with students and teachers at Turing, and learning how to properly use Github.  Being a functional member of the community is important in any field, but I am becoming more and more aware that it is especially important with web development.

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Our first project during Mod1 was Number Guesser, a game where users guess a randomly generated number.  Other individual projects included three static comp CSS challenges.

#### Number Guesser

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The Number Guesser project requires students to create a site that randomly generates a number, starting between 1-100.  Users will input a guess, then the application provides feedback as to whether their guess was correct, too high, or too low.  Upon a correct guess, the range would increase by ten on either side.  The user can set a custom range of numbers if they prefer.

##### Evaluator: Robbie

##### Notes:

##### UX/UI Expectations

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

##### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

##### Fundamental HTML

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

##### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


## Static Comp Challenges

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)
* [StaticComp2 GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/jb-comp-challenge-2)
* [StaticComp2 URL](https://johnbinning.github.io/jb-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

While the static comps have not been easy, they have been my favorite projects of Mod1.  I really enjoy the challenge of trying to get every detail correct.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We were given three group projects, Linked List, ideabox, and ToDoBox.

#### (Linked List)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/linked-list)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is a page where users can add and delete links to their favorite sites.  They can mark links as read, and if clicked links will open the stored url in a new tab.

### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VazGghcFbXZkeFrnJd_Jo_rGhgpqzbV0ObwjBOQeJr8/edit)

Idea Box was very similar to linked list, but allowed the ideas to persist based on utilizing local storage.

### ToDo Box Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/2DoBox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

With ToDo Box, we took another group's Idea Box and pivoted it into a new site.  ToDo box could filter ToDo's level of importance, and completed ideas could be recalled.  We used Selenium testing, and had to refactor the old code as well.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

It's interesting to look back on the first gear up of the mod now that we are at the end.  I can say that I have had some pretty strong moments of having having both a fixed and a growth mindset.  It has been valuable to be able to recognize what is happening during times of having a fixed mindset, and taking steps to switch back to growth.  I think this session has been and will continue to be valuable to me as I work my way through the highs and lows of Turing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

For Justyna Field, linked-list partner:

Working with Justyna was great.  We had wonderful give and take, and we agreed up front that no one would fall behind.  I feel like the pairing allowed me to learn by teaching Justyna, but at the same time I learned even more from what she taught me.  Our communication was excellent, and we were consequently able to stop any arguments before they even started.  I would be happy to work with her again.
