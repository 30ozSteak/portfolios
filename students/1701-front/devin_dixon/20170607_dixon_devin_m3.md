## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Shindig

* [Github](https://github.com/devthehuman/shindig)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

I wanted to build an app that allows users to track concerts in any given city across the user, add an event to a calendar
in their account, and then be able to communicate with other users who are attending the same shows. To accomplish this, I
utilized the Express boilerplate, React, Redux, Router, Knex, Jest and Enzyme.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We built three projects as a pair/group during this mod: Headcount, SWapibox, and Movie-Tracker

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub](https://github.com/kamos1/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 was an app to test our ability to manipulate data from an API. It was definitely a challenge figuring out how to 
render the correct data where we wanted to render it. It was built using the create-react-app boilerplate.

## Students: Keji Amos & Devin Dixon
## Evaluator: Taylor
## Notes:

Fix functionality for iteration 5.
Legend to understand data.
Did you need both search state & district state?
Question to always ask yourself is do I need State here.
Grades will change for propTypes fixed, iteration 5 done, CSS Legend.

## Specification Adherence
- 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

## Code Quality
- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## PropType Implementation
- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
  - Missing one PropTypes on CompareCard

## CSS/Design
- 2.5 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.

## Testing
- 2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

#### SWapi Box

* [GitHub](https://github.com/DBULL7/SWapi-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

This project was definitely the hardest out of all the projects this mod. Making nested api calls and rendering data based
on certain conditions was extremely challenging and it pushed me quite a bit. I took a lot of knowledge away from that and
grew as a developer because of that. 

## Students: Devin & Devon
## Instructor: Meeka

## Bug - if you navigate in, favorite a card, leave, navigate back - unfavorite is broken and no indication of favoriting on page load

## Go in and clean up e.curentTarget.textContent and things like that - should be coming in from the React component and not from the DOM

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### Movie-Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/devthehuman/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie Tracker was the first project in which we got to use React Redux and React Router, as well as work with a backend built
out by Taylor. It was a lot to take in and absorb, but I learned so much from struggling through the project. Also, working with 
an actual team of devs instead of just pairing was an awesome experience. It gave me a peek into what my actual job will be like.

### Specification Adherence  

* 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.

## D: Professional Skills
During this mod I got to put together a pretty decent resume, track jobs using Trello (which I had never used before), 
actually spent time really thinking about what I want out of a job (flower exercise), and did a bit of cold outreach.

### Gear Up
#### (Tragedy of the Commons)

#### (MicroAggresions)

#### (Sharing Priveledge)


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I ran IronFe on Wednesday mornings this module, and did my best to be available for screenhero pairing or in person help
whenever anybody needed it.
