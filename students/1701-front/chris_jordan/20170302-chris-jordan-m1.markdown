# Chris Jordan - M1 Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis

I set out to to learn all the basic fundamental skills (HTML, CSS, JS, working alongside others, ect.) required of me to become a front-end engineer. I feel I have much more to learn still, but enough of an understanding to solidify and expand on these basics. I obviously need to do better with my workflow, HTML semantics, organization, and feeling comfortable working on a professional level with others.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Dog-Party, Number Guesser, Mythical Creatures ,and the Static Compositions were all projects/assignments
done independently to push our skills as Web Developers to the fullest at the time.

#### Dog-Party:

https://github.com/cjorda15/dog-party  --GitHub
https://cjorda15.github.io/dog-party/  --Published Site
http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/html-1.html -- Original Assignment

The Dog Party assignment was a good starting point to get familiar with how to(and how not to) use HTMl semantically/structurally as well as styling it with CSS. It involved basically attempting to do
our best to reflect the composition given.


####  Number-Guesser:

https://github.com/cjorda15/number-game - GitHub
https://cjorda15.github.io/number-game/ --Published Site
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html -- Original Assignment

 Number Guesser is an application that has users attempting to guess a number, initially randomly generated between 1 and 100(the range increased by 20 each game). The user is told if the guess it is too low or too high until  guessing the right number. I was able to add a very basic two player component to the game.

 Notes:

 Need to fix the layout for 320 minimum
 Fix alignment in Header and centered game content (header is off-center to the right a bit)
 Fix footer element that is actually your header
 Some redundant and unused CSS
 Consider alternate approach for refactoring fun with the disabled states of your buttons. So instead of adding/removing class, experiment with turning on/off disabled attribute on the element
 Break up the monolithic functions that are gnarly if/else and nested if/else conditionals
 UX/UI Expectations

 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.
 Functional Expectations

 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
 Fundamental HTML

 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.
 Fundamental CSS

 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
 Fundamental JavaScript

 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

Static Composition Challenges

 These assignment was meant to challenge and expand our HTML & CSS skills  We were given creative license, however the objective was to build something that respected the integrity of the original design.

####  Static Composition 1

https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations -- Original Assignment

Each exercise challenged our skills in JavaScript.


## C: Group Work & Projects

For group work, we were given IdeaBox, Linked List, and 2DoBox-Pivot. These
were intended showcase the importance of working and learning with others and how best to
do so. It also was meant to improve upon our knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and local storage.


####   LinkedList

https://github.com/cjorda15/linkedList -- GitHub
https://cjorda15.github.io/linkedList/ -- Published Page
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html -- Original Assignment

Linked List is a JavaScript powered program that takes user's inputs on title and links for bookmarked webpages.

No notes available--(3's all around)



####  IdeaBox

https://github.com/devthehuman/idea-box --GitHub
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html -- Original Assignment

Project that had us expand on the principles of linked-list, but incorporated utilizing local storage on web-browsers.

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
JavaScript Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Collaboration

3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


####   2DoBox-Pivot

https://github.com/cjorda15/2DoBox-Pivot -- GitHub
https://cjorda15.github.io/2DoBox-Pivot/ -- Published Site
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html -- -- Original Assignment

2DoBox-Pivot was a project meant to introduce us to working with and refactoring other developer's code as well as
starting application testing. We also were to add new features to what truly was linkedList and transform it into a new application.

## D: Professional Skills

Truly appreciated the assistance in developing my Professional Skills with the Gear Ups, the guest speakers, and some of the spikes

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown

It was great to feel boundless in my abilities in almost anything, as long as I believed in it. I mean there's limits (still can't fly (sigh)). All jokes aside, it is a new way of thinking that makes me feel more comfortable about running into difficult, stressful, problems. This new attitude of wanting to hit that wall and then push it back further is much healthier.


### Professional Development Workshops

Personal branding will be essential when I get into the job market. Having the guidance to complete these 3 sites will go far I'm sure! But the feedback session was of most help to me.
Knowing how to work with others and take and give feedback in a very, thoughtful, but direct approach is exactly what will be needed once I become a Front End Developer


#### Feedback session

https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/feedback_1.md --Workshop URL
https://github.com/cjorda15/-Professional-Development-Workshops --GitHub

What I took away from the feedback session was how to take feedback without it being a personal attack,
as well as how to format my own feedback to others and have it be a impression of feedback and not anything else. Giving and taking feedback for what it is is a important skill to work on for both
my personal and professional life

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback


### Being a Community Member

Devin Dixon

       What do you believe are my strengths?

I think that you are very intelligent and determined to thoroughly understand a problem or solution before moving on to the next. You're kind and supportive and definitely have what it takes to be a great programmer.
What do you think I could improve upon?

      What do you think I could work on?

I think communication is an area that you could work on. Being able to effectively communicate, or even assert yourself, when collaborating is really important and you could definitely come out of your shell a bit more to achieve that.
    Anything else you might want to add or comment on?

All in all, you're an awesome dude and I'm looking forward to hanging for the next 6 months.

  Chris Bandrowsky

  If we were partners on a project, how did you feel about our group experience? Anything you liked? Any recommendations for the future?

n/a

  How have our interactions throughout the mod helped with your understanding of code, or the development of you as a programmer?

You can articulate concepts to all of us in a manner that is easy to understand. Your design background is very helpful as well in understanding that aspect of our work

  Have our interactions as a whole affected your experience as a Turing student?

Absolutely. It has only furthered my positive experience here at Turing.

  What are some things I could work on in future mods?

Voice your design mind more. Love hearing that shtuff

  Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?

Keep doing you man

  All things considered, wanna grab a beer?
Yes, of course!



  Overall, how was it working with me as a project partner and a human?

As a human, it was throughly a pleasure. Very kind, but direct.

  What strengths did I bring to our group?

Clear thinking and not afraid to voice any questions

What areas (technical or interpersonal) should I work on?
Believe in yo' self girl. If people you meet wish to talk about coding and its over your head at the time, then make it a lesson to expand on your knowledge, or just say scrooge this, Ima meet people who aren't lame.

### Playing a Part

Whenever fellow students showed any signs of stress with a coding problem or anything else, I have tried to extend my support in any way to hopefully alleviate the issue.

If a fellow student approached me wanting assistance with a coding problem, I would make sure to see if I could explain the problem in the simplest way possible and attempt to see it through with them. I feel I have taken great care, that whenever I do help others out, I don't say this is too easy or too hard of a concept or try to impress upon them any sense that I have this down (which I don't in most cases..). I always have tried to make this a partnership of tackling  a problem together rather than me explaining the solution.  

I check the slack channels to make sure that if there is any issues any fellow colleagues are having that I may have a solution for, I will send direct messages to them with advice.

Generally trying to be social and a human being to my cohort (though I'm usually
uncomfortable in most social situations outside of being with me close friends and family)   

Be a attentive listener to who ever is talking.

Take feedback with politeness and holistically (not be sensitive about the fact its
  my work). When I give feedback, its never ever negative, just simply what needs to
  be said in a direct, but subtle manner. If there is anything that needs to be said that
  can be interpreted as rude, I try to frame their situation as something I was doing too
  at some point.
