# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out out to learn all the basic fundamental skills (HTML, CSS, JS, and working alongside others) required of me to become a front-end engineer. I feel I have much more to learn still, but enough of an understanding to solidify and expand on these basics. I obviously need to do better with my workflow, organization, and feeling comfortable working on a professional level with others.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Dog-Party, Number Guesser, Mythical Creatures ,and the Static Compositions were all projects/assignments
done independently to push our skills as Web Developers to the fullest at the time.

Dog-Party:

http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/html-1.html -- Original Assignment

The Dog Party assignment was a good starting point to get familiar with how to(and how not to) use HTMl semantically/structurally as well as styling it with CSS. It involved basically attempting to do
our best to reflect the composition given.


Number-Guesser:

http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html -- Original Assignment

 Number Guesser is an application that has users attempting to guess a number, initially randomly generated between 1 and 100(the range increased by 20 each game). The user is told if the guess it is too low or too high until  guessing the right number. I was able to add a very basic two player component to the game.

 Notes:

 Need to fix the layout for 320 minimum
 Fix alignment in Header and centered game content (header is off-center to the right a bit)
 Fix footer element that is actually your header
 Some redundant and unused CSS
 Consider alternate approach for refactoring fun with the disabled states of your buttons. So instead of adding/removing class, experiment with turning on/off disabled attribute on the element
 Break up the monolithic functions that are gnarly if/else and nested if/else conditionals
 UX/UI Expectations

 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.
 Functional Expectations

 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
 Fundamental HTML

 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.
 Fundamental CSS

 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
 Fundamental JavaScript

 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax
