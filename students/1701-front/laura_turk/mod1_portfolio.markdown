# (Laura Turk) - (M1) Portfolio

## Front End

I wasn't sure what to expect from Turing. I knew it would be hard work. I knew -to use the cliche- I would be drinking from the firehose, and probably stressed out. My goals for this mod was to establish healhy habits in my life, and productive study habits to set me up for success for the length of the program.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual work includes one solo project and three static comps. It is exciting to see the growth I have made these past six weeks, especially with CSS.

#### (Number Guesser)

*   [Number Guesser](https://github.com/lauraturk/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

(Description) 
Laura Turk's most humble submission of the coding classic
Number Guesser
Game Rules
User guesses a number between 1 and 100. The initial range is not apparent, but a guess above or below will prompt the user to stay within the appropriate range.

User must first type a number before any of the buttons are active, and -once they have guessed- can click Clear to guess again or Reset the game to clear the input field, their previous guess, and create a new random number.

A winning guess increases the difficulty of the game by dropping the min range and raising the max range by 10.

A non-numerical guess or a guess outside of the range returns "NOPE" and prompts for a number within the range.

This game can be played on a desktop as well as on a mobile phone with a screen size larger than 320px.)

(evaluation comments)
I had too many global variables and should have put more into functions. It was instructive in my evaluation to have Bree explain how that would work.
Revisit layout for the 320 size
Revisit UX for set range and how the user understands and gets feedback about guessing a new number w/in new range
Revisit JS for refactoring around less global variables and looking into case/switch for if/else business
UX/UI Expectations

(evaluation scores)
Evaluator: Bree

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.
Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
Fundamental HTML

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.
Fundamental CSS

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Fundamental JavaScript

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

#### (Static Comp 1)

(description)
An experiment with flexbox, I enjoyed 1. finding an agreeable color palettes, and mining the depths of the Bluth Ipsum. I struggeld with handling the background image and linking to it appropriately (I used 4? to make it repsonsive).

(evaluation comments)
My color palette was good. It didn't work on the large screen, and my background image was screwy.

I set two goals for this 1. don't rely on flexbox and 2. experiment with ems. I am really happy I did not rely on flexbox as it cemented how the box model operates and set me up for success in 3.

(evaluation comments)
Color pallete was good. Font was small.

icons are filler sprites and would be further modified to provide for differentiation.
font-family: Alegreya Sans SC for all caps otherwise Alegreya Sans is used. In a broader application, it may be useful to change these fonts as google rates their load speed as SLOW.

This comp challenge was, indeed, a challenge. It was encouraging to feel like I was beginning to understand how to approach and organize a CSS challenge of this size. Despite that I still feel like my CSS is slow and I look forward to flexing this muscle more.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
I found paired projects to be more challenging than I anticipated. I've done a lot of group and committee work in my past, but it was often 'take these distinct pieces and we'll compile them all together later'. Dividing tasks and pairing on smaller projects that had less defined break points was harder on an interpersonal level than I anticipated. I learned how to divide those tasks, how to support my partner, how to manage my own stress and not try to manage my partner's, and how to speak up when I felt like my partner was getting ahead of me. I am proud of the work in these three projects.

February 27, 2017

Laura Turk and I paired on the Link List project.  Working with Laura was great! We got together and laid a solid foundation utilizing the DTR memo. We each communicated our expectations, areas where we wanted to grow, and how we wanted to execute this project together.  

Laura is a true professional and a great communicator.  She’s open to hearing new ideas and willing to step outside the box and implement them. Laura wasn’t afraid to tackle the  parts of the project that were new to her, she jumped in and drilled into every aspect of the project.  

I really appreciated having the opportunity to pair with her.  I think she is going to be a fantastic web developer.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
##### To Kristi Green
Kristi, working with you on Linked List was a wonderful learning experience and a pleasure. While it was more challenging to pair on a project at Turing than I anticipated -the time pressure, the difficulty of dividing tasks on a project of this size, and my general trepidatious understanding of the material- working with you made a difficult thing inherently less challenging.

Our greatest strength as a team was your proactive approach to communication. I appreciated that you kept the lines of communication open, that you reached out for us to work together, jumped to get us very necessary help, and tried new ways to communicate! I also appreciated your patience with my ‘throw it at the wall and see what sticks’ method of doing css. While it may have (ha! definitely) slowed us down, it was a useful learning experience for me to be more measured and thoughtful in my approach.

I am drawing a blank on any feedback I could give you to improve future partnerships. The only thing would be that we could have both benefited from increased optimization of the git and github workflow, and again, your patience as we figured out how to use that tool was incredible. 

Thank you and I hope to work with you again soon!

#####To Kenia Faris
Pairing with Kenia was a breakthrough for my partner and I. She did an excellent job walking us through the problem and sharing her knowledge with out directly feeding us the code. After just an hour I left feeling much more comfortable with our project and the concepts that we were learning. I would highly recommend people seek her out for pairing!

### Being a Community Member
#####Overall, how was it working with me as a project partner and a human?
You are a great human. I hope we get to do a project together someday.
I never officially partnered with you but I find you to be a delightful human and I enjoy our discussions!
As a human, it was throughly a pleasure. Very kind, but direct.

#####What strengths did I bring to our group?

We were not official project partners, but you provided me a lot of moral support. I enjoyed our conversations and I think we talked about coding some of the time.
Honesty, strong educational background, cute dog pictures
Clear thinking and not afraid to voice any questions.

#####What areas (technical or interpersonal) should I work on?

Don't get a "thicker skin". Find a place to work that you can be you.
I can't think of any. I'm sorry, I know that's not helpful! I do think you did a rad job tackling the pairing conflict you had earlier this mod :)
Believe in yo' self girl. If people you meet wish to talk about coding and its over your head at the time, then make it a moment as a lesson to expand on your knowledge, or just say fuck this, Ima meet people who aren't lame.

I had a great experience pairing with Laura. She had a good understanding of her code an was able to talk me through the problems that they wanted to fix. It was very easy to jump into her code and follow the logic. She is a great problem solver and it was easy for me to guide her to the answer. It was a great pairing and she was very open to receiving feedback and asking questions when something I said didn't make sense.
