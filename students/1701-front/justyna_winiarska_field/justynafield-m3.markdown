(description)


### Evaluator: Meeka

### Project Partner: Travis Gregory


#### Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

#### Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

#### PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

#### CSS/Design
- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

#### Testing

Not expected to update this project, teammates should focus on next testing in SwapiBox.

- 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested


## SWAPIbox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/SWAPIbox)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

### Evaluator: Taylor
### Project Partner: Laura Turk


#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

#### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

#### Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

#### Testing

3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing



## Movie Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/movie-tracker)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

### Evaluator: Jhun
### Partners on the Project: Leta Keane, Kelly Miller, Devin Dixon



#### Specification Adherence  

* 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

#### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.


#### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


#### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

#### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.
