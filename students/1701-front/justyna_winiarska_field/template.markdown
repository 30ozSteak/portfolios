Below is the list of my solo projects that I have been working on.

#### Number Guesser

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

In this project I got to build my very first javascript functionaly. It was challenging but extremely rewarding in the end.


Evaluator: Bree

Notes:
Excellent markup with fantastic accessibility considerations
Suggest adding link tag for Open Sans font
Suggest working on the min/max feature of the app
UX/UI Expectations

UX/UI Expectations
3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

Fundamental HTML
4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

Fundamental CSS
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Fundamental JavaScript
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

Last of the three html/css challenges in Mod 1. The aim of the project was to recreate the comp. Breakpoints for responsive leayouts were not provided, students used their own judgement to create medium and small device layouts. Creative license was given in regards to images, icons and copy.


Evaluator: Bree

Notes:
I really appreciate your attention and care where accessibility is concerned. Keep it up!
Solid design eye
While we discussed areas of improvement in markup and CSS, it was overall well structured and organized

Design Integrity
4: The comp beautifully articulates the original design intent and there are no areas where an instructor would make changes with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements.

Responsive Layout
3:  The comp logically breaks down across several breakpoints to accommodate mobile, tablet, desktop, and large format screens. While there are areas for improvement, nothing is lost or illegible across any of the screen sizes.

HTML Style
3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.

CSS Style
3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Feedback from John: Working with Justyna was great.  We had wonderful give and take, and we agreed up front that no one would fall behind.  I feel like the pairing allowed me to learn by teaching Justyna, but at the same time I learned even more from what she taught me.  Our communication was excellent, and we were consequently able to stop any arguments before they even started.  I would be happy to work with her again.
