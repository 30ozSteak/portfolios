## Instructor: yung-jhun
### Comments:

- UI is hilarious
- Loved the sounds and the experience of the game
- Would love to see logic broken out of World and move things like game rendering and starting to a game class
- move some of the collisions to block // a collisions class
- Would like to see more tests for World if the majority of responsibility stays with world.


### Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
