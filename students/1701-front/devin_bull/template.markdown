(Intro)


#### Number Guesser

*   [Project Github](https://github.com/DBULL7/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-curriculum/blob/gh-pages/projects/number-guesser.md)

(description)
Number Guesser was our first Javascript project. We took basic input and checked if it was within a range. Based on how close they were to the randomly generated number, the game would give the user feedback in the form of messages, color changes, etc. 


Address alignment issues at the larger screen sizes
Adress colors for enabled/disabled state on buttons
Address redundant and overwriting CSS
Consider putting back the focus on inputs for accessibility, but you can change the color to match your project palette
See if you can refactor that if/else statement. Check out JS switch statements.
