(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### (Number Guesser)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment]            (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was a web app that generated a random number and allowed the user to guess it. It told the user if the guess was too high, too low or correct. There were also buttons to clear the fields, reset the game, and submit your answer.

* Watch the formatting in html, don't need so many line breaks
* Some redundancy, remember fonts are inherited properties
* JS - overall looking good, however should shore up the event listener code for the guess button. Use one addListener to call the various functions you want to run.

UX/UI Expectations

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two
Fundamental HTML

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.
Fundamental CSS

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Fundamental JavaScript

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

#### (Static Comp 1)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/sh-comp-challenge-1)
*   [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

We were required to match the comp provided. This included using FlexBox to create a grid layout on the comp.


##### Comments
The color scheme was not good as there was not enough contrast between the grid boxes. I needed to better align the small icons with the words next to them in the profile box near the top of the page. There should also have been more break points to ensure that all screen sizes looked good. Lastly, the font should have been different than the default and there should have been more breathing room around the text.

#### (Static Comp 2)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/sh-comp-challenge-2)
*   [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

We were required to match the comp provided. This included using FlexBox to create the different cards on the page and styling things within the card.


##### Comments
There were some shenanigans on the mobile size of the screen, including the nav elements getting kicked out of the header. The cards got a little bit cramped before being kicked down to the next line, which means that I should have had more media queries to solve some of the sizing issues.

#### (Static Comp 3)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/sh-comp-challenge-3)
*   [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

We were required to match the comp provided. This was by the most complicated comp. This involved having a side navigation bar that disappeared when the screen shrunk. This comp required the use of an incredible amount of divs and sections in order to get things styled the way they needed it to be.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (Linked List)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/linked_list)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List was a group project that had us create a web app that compiled bookmark titles and url's. We had to create input fields and then prepend the information in an empty section on the right side of the screen.

Overall, good use of JavaScript. Used Flex in a place where we didn't necessarily need to, which changed the way that our cards were prepending to the page.

Functional Expectations

3.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
Fundamental JavaScript Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Soft three


#### (IdeaBox)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/ideabox)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

The IdeaBox project required us to create a box on the page that would hold different idea titles and idea bodies. It was also required that we use local storage to make the information that we were storing on the page available even on a page reload. We needed to be able to pull things from local storage, make edits and change qualities, and then re-enter that information into storage.

(evaluation scores)

Leta Keane: "I really enjoyed working with you, both on IdeaBox and on our sprites spike! I appreciated that you were proactive with communication. Struggling with the jQuery felt bearable because we were both open about how tough it was, and I think we came up with good solutions together.  Putting together a very last minute spike also felt like a breeze, because you are so calm and collected :slightly_smiling_face: It was easy in both the project and the spike to divvy up tasks, because I knew you'd be vocal about any issues or reservations you had.

Thanks for a great paired project experience!"

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Personal Stories and Connection)

*   [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_personal_story.markdown)

This session made me think about aspects of myself and my personality that I normally wouldn't devote the time to thinking about. It is necessary to know what is most important to you and how you are displaying those qualities to other people. I also liked how this idea was carried over to the overall group and how individual differences and similarities can give added value to the cohort, the school, and relationships in your advice.

### PROtocol
#### (DTR)

*   [Link to Completed Deliverables] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmqPNmb4Kn19FfIxI9VBZl5DLnYe4-hVvDK3WYl_LPI/edit?usp=sharing)

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Learning to Pair)

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmqPNmb4Kn19FfIxI9VBZl5DLnYe4-hVvDK3WYl_LPI/edit?usp=sharing))

This session taught me how important it was to recognize my communication styles and how it might not necessarily be the same for everyone. I consider myself a good communicator but that doesn't mean that everyone will agree or that everyone will communicate in the same way. I learned how important it was to define the relationship, goals, and expectations that come before a project, instead of hoping that they're the same. This allowed me to have great pair projects.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Leta Keane: "Thank you for being such a great project partner. IdeaBox was one of the most stressful projects that I had to get through and you asking clarifying questions, both of me and of our pairing partner, was incredibly helpful and informative. Thank you for taking the brunt of the work for the Sprite Spike and for teaching me how to use them on the project. I appreciated the fact that even though there were stressful portions of IdeaBox, we were always able to work through a problem together and ensure that we got the project done on time and finished with a great grade. Thank you, also, for creating the DTR before the project. It gave us a good foundation for moving forward on the project. I look forward to working on projects and Spikes with you in the future!"

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

I ran a Sprite Spike with Lita, which seemed to be informative for Mod-1 students. I also organized a meeting with people in the Front End program to discuss changes to Mod 1 to fix some of the complaints that we were having.


### Self-Assessment

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.


I feel that with each project increasing in difficulty, I have achieved grades of three's starting from the beginning and progressed toward 3.5's towards the end of the mod. I feel that I have increased my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript, CSS and HTML. While still having a lot of room for improvement, I feel that I have generally continued to do better on each project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

Soft 3.5: I feel that I have gotten along well with every project partner that I have had. I also like to think that I have helped my partners understand new concepts, while not being too shy to ask for help in understanding things that they seem to have mastered. I have never had an argument or felt like there was frustration toward me or toward my communication through any of the projects.

## D: Professional Development

3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.

Soft 3.5: I have been active and involved in professional development courses. More importantly, I feel that I have actively used skills and concepts discussed in professional development, including pairing suggestions and updating information on all of my professional accounts.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond supports of the community.

I was excited and grateful to be able to lead a Sprite Spike with Leta toward the end of Mod 1. This gave me an opportunity to better teach myself a topic that had not been entirely taught in class and to ensure that I understood it enough to demonstrate to the class. I also did some organization of our Mod to discuss any frustrations that we were having in order to find some actionable steps towards the betterment of our experience.
