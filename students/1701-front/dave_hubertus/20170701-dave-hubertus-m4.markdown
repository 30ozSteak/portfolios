# Dave Hubertus - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  I came into Mod 4 with the intentions of gaining a deeper understanding of server side development. I enjoyed building out front and back end portions of our applications as it began to solidify how the two depend upon each other. Hosting our applications also forced me to take a deep dive into understanding configuration files. After having made my way through Mod 4, I feel comfortable with my ability to assess a problem and find a solution in an orangized matter.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects


### BYOB

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/byob)

#### Feature Delivery
##### Documentation
9 points: The README includes documentation for all available endpoints and how to use them. Instructor can follow the documentation for using the API but has to do some parsing.
##### Feature Completion
50 points: Completed almost all features, but lacking a relationship between the two data tables.
##### Testing Linting Error Handling
30 points: Project has a running test suite that covers happy and sad paths for each endpoint. Error handling has been implemented and linter is passing.
##### JavaScript Style
20 points: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


## B: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

### Jet Fuel

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/jet-fuel)

#### Specification Adherence
50 points: No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface
15 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Data Persistence with SQL Database
20 points - The application persists data in a SQL database but with correct relationships between folders and URLs.

#### Testing
10 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. Tests are commented out/failing currently (CircleCI) - need these to be passing

#### JavaScript Style
12 points - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing. Need more RESTful routes.

#### Workflow
20 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.



### Peer Reivews
Jack Bevis - Working with you on Headcount went really well. We have a pretty strong rapport to begin with and brought the same attitude to the project. As such we were able to accomplish the goals for the project, and burn through some tough challenges in order to do so. I also want to say thanks again for shouldering a brunt of the project over the weekend while I was out of town. That was not ideal, but we were able to get it done. Great pairing, and looking forward to more collaboration.

Jenn Peavler - Dave communicates expectation and roles clearly.  He is approachable and adaptable.  He has a solid understanding of the subject manner and is able to express his thought process clearly.  He works relentlessly to get the job done, and takes pride in his work.  In order to grow as a developer, it is my recommendation that Dave keep up the good work, but perhaps sometimes, take a step back from the project and look at the flow of the application as a whole.  This will enable Dave to be able to understand how to break up the whole project into smaller, more attackable functionality problems.  Can’t wait to work with Dave again, as he most definitely rocks.

Chris Bandrowski - Working with Dave was a great experience, especially in a group setting. It was enjoyable to constantly bounce ideas off of each other to see where we could go with the project. Although the project was stressful, it was great to work with Dave and the others as they were great supportive team mates.

Keji Amos - You are a great teammate. You are good at staying on top of todos and making sure if there are questions they get answered.

### Playing a Part

I have participated in most, if not all events, that have been required of Turing students. However when considering taking on tasks outside of course work, I have shied away due to fear of taking on too many tasks. Having a better understanding of the course load and Turing’s all around structure, I look forward to some of the opportunities the Turing community has to offer.
