# Dave Hubertus - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  Entering Turing, I had little to no experience with programming. I was unsure what to expect or even how to set a goal for a topic I knew little about. Understanding the fast pace of the program Id have to say my goals were to be able to comprehend the subject matter in a quick manner and keep pace with the guidelines set forth by Turing and its curriculum. Now, having completed module one, I am pleased with the progress I have made as an individual and as team.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 3
*   **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Individual Coding Challenge:

##### Evaluator: Nate
#### Optional Notes:
* Good communication skills and laying out your approach as you work
* Good job recognizing your concatenation issue and identifying you need to parseInt
* Great progression getting through the features smoothly

#### Progression/Completion
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### JavaScript Style
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Front End Module One Projects are designed to improve our skills and increase our exposure to multiple facets of programming. Each project builds upon the last and increases in complexity. Projects have exposed us to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, JSON and Local Storage.


### Sorting Suite

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

#### UX/UI Expectations
2: Application meets the basic spirit of the comp but overlooks many details. Extensions show questionable design decisions that negatively impact the overall UX/UI. Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

#### Fundamental HTML
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

#### Fundamental CSS
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Fundamental JavaScript
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


### Complete-Me

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/dh-comp-challenge-3)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity.



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Front End Module One Projects are designed to improve our skills and increase our exposure to multiple facets of programming. Each project builds upon the last and increases in complexity. Projects have exposed us to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, JSON and Local Storage.


### Game Time

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Adamj1232/LinkedList)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
*   [DTR](https://github.com/Adamj1232/LinkedList)

Build an application that can save a URL and title into two inputs and on click of submit to save the bookmark to your webpage.

#### Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

#### Fundamental JavaScript Style
3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring. 

#### Workflow
3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base. 

#### HTML Style
4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. 
Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors. 

#### CSS Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.



### Weatherly

*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/dhubertus/portfolios/edit/master/students/1701-front/dave_hubertus/template.markdown)

Build an application that can save a URL and title into two inputs and on click of submit to save the bookmark to your webpage. The bookmarks should be stored in local storage and persist on the page after refresh.

#### Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### HTML Style
3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow
3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Collaboration
3.5 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


### Playing a Part

I have participated in most, if not all events, that have been required of Turing students. However when considering taking on tasks outside of course work, I have shied away due to fear of taking on too many tasks. Having a better understanding of the course load and Turingâ€™s all around structure, I look forward to some of the opportunities the Turing community has to offer.
