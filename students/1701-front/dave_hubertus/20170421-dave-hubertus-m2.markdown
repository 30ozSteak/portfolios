# Dave Hubertus - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  I came into Mod 2 with the intentions increasing my skills in javascript, getting comfortable with ES6, and gaining skills with data structures and array/object/string prototypes. After having made my way through Mod 2, I feel comfortable with my ability to assess a problem and find a solution in an orangized matter.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

*   **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
*   **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
*   **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
*   **D: Professional Skills**: 3
*   **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Individual Coding Challenge:

##### Evaluator: Nate
#### Optional Notes:
* Good communication skills and laying out your approach as you work
* Good job recognizing your concatenation issue and identifying you need to parseInt
* Great progression getting through the features smoothly

#### Progression/Completion
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

#### JavaScript Style
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

#### Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Front End Module One Projects are designed to improve our skills and increase our exposure to multiple facets of programming. Each project builds upon the last and increases in complexity. Projects have exposed us to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, JSON and Local Storage.


### Sorting Suite

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

#### UX/UI Expectations
2: Application meets the basic spirit of the comp but overlooks many details. Extensions show questionable design decisions that negatively impact the overall UX/UI. Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

#### Fundamental HTML
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

#### Fundamental CSS
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Fundamental JavaScript
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


### Complete-Me

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dhubertus/dh-complete-me)

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity.

#### Fundamental JavaScript & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Functional Expectations
3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### Code Sanitation
4 - Zero complaints



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Front End Module One Projects are designed to improve our skills and increase our exposure to multiple facets of programming. Each project builds upon the last and increases in complexity. Projects have exposed us to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, JSON and Local Storage.


### Game Time

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DBULL7/breakout)

Build an application that can save a URL and title into two inputs and on click of submit to save the bookmark to your webpage.

#### Functional Expectations
3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Testing
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation
4 - Zero complaints


### Weatherly

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Adamj1232/CloudKicker-WeatherForecast-ReactProject)

Build an application that can save a URL and title into two inputs and on click of submit to save the bookmark to your webpage. The bookmarks should be stored in local storage and persist on the page after refresh.

#### Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### HTML Style
3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS Style
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow
3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Collaboration
3.5 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


### Playing a Part

I have participated in most, if not all events, that have been required of Turing students. However when considering taking on tasks outside of course work, I have shied away due to fear of taking on too many tasks. Having a better understanding of the course load and Turingâ€™s all around structure, I look forward to some of the opportunities the Turing community has to offer.
