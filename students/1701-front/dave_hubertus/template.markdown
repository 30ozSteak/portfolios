# Dave Hubertus - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

  Entering Turing, I had little to no experience with programming. I was unsure what to expect or even how to set a goal for a topic I knew little about. Understanding the fast pace of the program Id have to say my goals were to be able to comprehend the subject matter in a quick manner and keep pace with the guidelines set forth by Turing and its curriculum. Now, having completed module one, I am pleased with the progress I have made as an individual and as team.
