## A: End of Module Assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects went really well this mod. It was wonderful getting to collaborate with many members from my cohort. 

#### Sorting Suite

This project was an introduction to three different sorting algorithms. The three I completed are bubble sort, 
insertion sort, and merge sort. 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects taught me a lot about myself and were overall a good experience.
My first group project, Linked List, I felt like I was unable to contribute as much to the javascript as I would have liked.
This motivated me to really push myself in javascript and become much more confident in manipulating the dom.
In my last two projects I realized I am not as good at navigating as I need/want to be so this has become my main
goal for mod 2.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

See Keji. 

### Being a Community Member

From Keji Amos:
I appreciated that we had similar backgrounds, coming from education. I think that was very useful in allowing us to work well 
together. You're organized, a good planner, and you're a quick study.



### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
Once I became a little more comfortable in the community I made efforts especially during retros and other cohort specific
times to become an active participant in the community. I attended a couple of lunch roulettes even though mine never worked
out, so that I could get to know those outside our mod. In addition I participated in a couple of pairings and joined the
Pahlka spikes most weeks. This is an area I want to continue to improve in by actively trying to get to know those from other
mods and attending events such as Joan Clarke.
