Summary of Project

##### Evaluator: Jhun

* Evaluator Notes: None

##### Evaluation Scores:

##### _1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style_

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### _2. Test-Driven Development_

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

###### _3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components_

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

###### _4. Functional Expectations_

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

###### _5. Code Sanitation_

* 4 - Zero complaints


### (Complete-Me)

// only use returns when needed, use objects vs key values in strings
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### _2. Test-Driven Development_

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

##### _3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components_
// pass dictionary into populate for 3.5
* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### _4. Functional Expectations_
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

## C: Group Work & Projects

Summary

### (Gametime)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cbandrow/gametime)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Summary

#### Evaluator: Nate

#### Evaluation Scores:

##### Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


### (Weathrly)

##### Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

##### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
Turing has done an excellent job in teaching me interpersonal skills that can apply across the industry and across professional developer interactions. Through Gear Ups, casual conversation, guest speakers, and otherwise, I've learned a great deal about functioning as a Developer in the work world.

### DTR

Defining the Relationship was an invaluable step for ensuring our pairing success in projects throughout the module. DTR's are useful for determining how my partner and I could be the best partners possible.
