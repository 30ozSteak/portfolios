* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

###### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
// pass dictionary into populate for 3.5
* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

###### 4. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

## D: Professional Skills
Turing has done an excellent job in teaching me interpersonal skills that can apply across the industry and across professional developer interactions. Through Gear Ups, casual conversation, guest speakers, and otherwise, I've learned a great deal about functioning as a Developer in the work world.

### DTR

Defining the Relationship was an invaluable step for ensuring our pairing success in projects throughout the module. DTR's are useful for determining how my partner and I could be the best partners possible.
