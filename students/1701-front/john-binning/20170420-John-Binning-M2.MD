## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Complete-Me is a project where students are asked to build an auto-complete trie in Javascript


# Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me
# Instructor: Jhun
# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3.5:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We were given two group projects, Game Time, and Weathrly.

#### (Game Time)

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/game-time)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Game Time is a project where students are asked to make an arcade game in Javascript using the HTML Canvas element

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
# Instructor: yung-jhun
# Comments:

- UI is hilarious
- Loved the sounds and the experience of the game
- Would love to see logic broken out of World and move things like game rendering and starting to a game class
- move some of the collisions to block // a collisions class
- Would like to see more tests for World if the majority of responsibility stays with world.


## Functional Expectations

* 3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints


#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VazGghcFbXZkeFrnJd_Jo_rGhgpqzbV0ObwjBOQeJr8/edit)

Idea Box was very similar to linked list, but allowed the ideas to persist based on utilizing local storage.

#### Evaluator: Louisa

#### Specification Adherence
* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### HTML Style
* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

#### CSS Style
* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### JavaScript Style
* 3.5- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow
* 3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### Collaboration
* 3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


#### ToDo Box Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JohnBinning/2DoBox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

With ToDo Box, we took another group's Idea Box and pivoted it into a new site.  ToDo box could filter ToDo's level of importance, and completed ideas could be recalled.  We used Selenium testing, and had to refactor the old code as well.

#### Evaluator: Louisa

#### Instructor Evaluation Points

#### Specification Adherence
4 - The application meets all of the phase requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

#### User Interface
3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions,  the application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### HTML Style
3.5 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### JavaScript Style
3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components.

#### Testing
4 - Project has a running test suite. The test suite covers all aspects of the application.

#### Workflow
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

It's interesting to look back on the first gear up of the mod now that we are at the end.  I can say that I have had some pretty strong moments of having having both a fixed and a growth mindset.  It has been valuable to be able to recognize what is happening during times of having a fixed mindset, and taking steps to switch back to growth.  I think this session has been and will continue to be valuable to me as I work my way through the highs and lows of Turing.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I learned that I need to focus on recognizing when I'm stuck.  When I do get stuck, I need to find a way to get myself out of a rut.  I also recognized that worrying about the whole process of learning to code is just going to be frustrating.  It's best to take things one project/day at a time, and I can accomplish this by breaking down/splitting up difficult/daunting tasks.  I also need to go easier on myself on my mistakes.



#### Debugging the Gender Gap

I found the quote about women in history interesting "Women are an equal part of the past but not an equal part of history".
When they spoke about not having computer sciense as a subject in high school, I could really relate, I wish I could have been exposed to the subject much earlier.

Two biggest takeaways: 
-it's almost if not completely impossible for me to understand the experiences of people who are a different gender, race... than I am if no one speaks up
-it's much easier to develop applications that are usable for everyone when we have a diverse team of developers.

### PROtocol

*   [PROtocol slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f0cDlu4u5ZnM0WjpCpPfBcCJ9n3qRknqYjaqh8DdJVs/edit#slide=id.g1c505a3b55_0_258)

I learned that I need to be sensitive to how I give an receive feedback.  It is important to stop and think about how I am perceiving/giving feedback based on how I'm feeling.

### Professional Development Workshops

*   [Workshop URL](http://backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/identity_essentials)
*   [Github](https://github.com/JohnBinning)
*   [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-binning-289607132/)
*   [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/7484758/john-binning)

I recognize the value of looking professional on social media.  Social media is a great way to network, and could lead to job leads.  It influences other people's impressions of you.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### For Justyna Field, Complete-Me partner:

Working with Justyna was great.  We had wonderful give and take, and we agreed up front that no one would fall behind.  I feel like the pairing allowed me to learn by teaching Justyna, but at the same time I learned even more from what she taught me.  Our communication was excellent, and we were consequently able to stop any arguments before they even started.  I would be happy to work with her again.




### Being a Community Member

#### From Justyna Field, linked-list partner: 

 I really enjoyed working with John. We determined our working relationship right away with great respect of each other’s working habits and schedule differences. During our work process we exchanged clarifying questions. If there was any part of the project that one of us did not fully understand we would stop and take time to walk each other through the problem and make sure that we both fully understand that topic. I feel like we both equally contributed into the project, it was a very good pairing experience.
 
#### From  Jason Lucas, Mod1 pairing partner

##### How was my communication
* Very good.

##### What did I do well?
* John did a very good job of making sure that I understood each step of Mythical Creatures instead of just walking me thru the process.  

##### How can I improve for next time?
* Bring coffee

#### From Laura Turk, Weathrly partner:

##### How was my communication
* Your communication is excellent. I appreciated your frequent checkins and your explanation of your thought process. You are a conscientious communicator, aware of turn-taking and not dominating any interaction, and it makes for an extremely pleasant and productive pairing. 

##### What did I do well?
* Your understanding of javascript, css and ability to troubleshoot code are excellent. You obviously have a thorough understanding of concepts and are able to explain them well. You did an great job of dividing the tasks, setting clear expectations, and communicating where you were, what you wanted to accomplish, what our next steps should be, and how you were planning to do so. You humored my silliness and had a casual rapport, which facilitated remaining stress-less during stressful moments. I really enjoyed partnering with you and hope to do so again! :tada: :taco:

##### How can I improve for next time?
* I would encourage you to apply some project management paradigm to your projects to safe-guard against following a single functionality's rabbit-hole and keep the project moving forward. We both tended to get bogged down on a single problem, and perhaps wasted some valuable time in doing so. I think you did a good job of saying, "maybe we should table this" , and I think those moments probably could have come earlier.


### Playing a Part

I feel that I stepped up as a community member this mod.  I joined the Pahlka Posse and helped lead a spike on accessibility.  I also opened myself up to pairing and paired with several mod1 students and set up a mentor.
