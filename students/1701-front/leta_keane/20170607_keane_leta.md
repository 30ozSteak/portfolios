### Module 3 (Front-end)
  # Individual Assessment: Pass!
  
  --------------
  # Projects:
    ## Project: Headcount2.0  
    ## Students: Leta Keane & Spencer Hilvitz
    ## Evaluator: Taylor
    ## Notes:

    UI - add a legend to help users understand what the numbers indicate.
    Refactoring, reusing the Card component.
    Understanding what your data is at all time with PropType.
    What needs to be held in state, try not to duplicate things help on App.

    ## Specification Adherence
    - 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

    ## Code Quality
    - 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

    ## PropType Implementation

    - Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
     Make sure to understand the data flow.

    ## CSS/Design
    - 2.5 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.

    ## Testing
    - 2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
    
    
    ## SWAPIbox
    ## Students: Leta & Jack
    ## Instructor: Taylor
    ## Notes: Great project, break out helper functions to there own file. Try to break logic from the return. Also take out redundant code

    ### Specification Adherence
    3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

    ### Code Quality
    3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

    ### Design
    4 - Zero major changes requested by evaluator.

    ### Testing
    3.5 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing



    
    ## Project: MovieTracker
    ## Students: Kelly, Justyna, Leta, Devin
    ## Instructor: Jhun
    
    ### Specification Adherence  
    * 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

    ### Redux Architecture
    * 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

    ### Routing
    * 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

    ### JavaScript Style
    * 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

    ### Testing
    * 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

    ### Workflow
    * 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each otherâ€™s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.
    
    
    
    # Project: emotican (self-directed)
    ## Student: Leta
    ## Instructor: Meeka

    ### Project Scope
    A good project idea should:

    * Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
    * Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
    * Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

    ### Feature Delivery
    **1. Completion**
    * 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

    **2. Organization**
    * 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

    ### Technical Quality
    **1. Test-Driven Development**
    * 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

    **2. Code Quality**
    * 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

    ### Product Experience
    **1. User Experience**
    * 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

    **2. Performance**
    * 4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

 # Community:
    * A recap of reflections from Gear Up
      * Microaggressions:
        - It was a really good conversation with Anders and Laura. We discussed the importance of recognizing microaggressions happening to others, and not expecting the experiencer to educate the observer
      * Tragedy of the Commons:
        - More great conversations with a mix of mods and programs - mostly centering around how to make a non-diverse workplace more diverse.
        - We talked about the need for the majority to be actively advocating for diversity and inclusion (rather than relying on a few diverse members to pull everyone else along)
        - We talked about how a diverse team creates demonstrably, factually BETTER APPS with a broader reach.
      * The Dangers of the Single Story (led by Mod 4):
        - This also spawned similar conversations: the need to realize that your assumptions are not facts, and that you have to take the time, even with people you think you know well, to get to know them more, and to hear their perspective
