## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- As a repeater, I wanted to take the time to really understand the lectures and to be able to follow along with the code examples.  I feel like I have been successful this time around (since I was a repeater).  

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- I still struggle with ActiveRecord.  I'm getting better and am learning new ways to use it.  

## Blog

My blog is about testing in RSpec and capybara.  It shows how to set up a basic test as well as some tips to make your testing more legible and useful.   

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord? Yes, absolutely.  My plan is to do it over again over the break.  I wish there was a way to practice it online like the sql course.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

- Favorite was little shop.  I enjoyed working with my group partners and I feel like I learned a good deal more about testing.   

- Least favorite was solo little shop.  I had a hard time focusing on the project when we had some many other things due around the same time.  

What did you learn from your independent projects?

- Time management is really important.  Getting more done up front was really helpful for me, especially in LaughTracks.  

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?

- I learned you can test features using shoulda-matchers.  I don't recommend it but you can do it.  I got more comfortable with testing as well.  


## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?  I did my best to help my cohort with project questions, especially early on.  

What would you like to do to contribute next module?  I would like to help the future mod 2 students work on their projects.  

### Member of a Posse

What did you do with your posse over this module?  Not much going on in the podcast posse this inning.  

What is your favorite thing about the posse experience? I've met several folks in other mods and the front end program.  It's been great to get to know people.  

How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional? I've learned to network with people.
