Projects

Completed three group projects.  The first in Sintra and the other two in Ruby on Rails
Little Shop

Built in Sinatra.  

* Git hub - https://github.com/mikecm1141/little-shop-redux
* Spec - https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux
For the evaluation we'll work through the project expectations and look at the following criteria:
1. Feature Completeness
* Meets Expectations: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented
2. Views
* Meets Expectations: Views make use of layout(s)
3. Controller
* Meets Expectations: Controller is generally well organized with three or fewer methods needing refactoring
4. Models
* Meets Expectations: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
5. ActiveRecord
* Below Expectations: Ruby is used to programmatically solve problems where ActiveRecord could be used
6. Testing
* Meets Expectations: Project has a running test suite that tests at multiple levels
7. Usability
* Meets Expectations: Project is usable, but needs more polish or navigation before it'd be customer-ready
8. Workflow
* Meets Expectations: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
