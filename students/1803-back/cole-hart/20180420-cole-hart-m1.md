## Areas of Emphasis

I aimed to become better at elemental Ruby language characteristics - storing data in different structures, understanding how to pass information between methods, classes and modules and becoming as comfortable as possible with the Turing educational environment.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was a Student Advisory Board (SAB) representative of Mod 1 BEE this inning. I helped organize and man the social for the inning, the inning code fair, suggested a relationship/significant others of Turing support group that Joanne will be implementing with the help of alumnae couples next mod, and facilitated a meetup for Queer Qoders and the board chairperson of the local branch of a national LGBTQ non-profit to help find equitable and accepting work placement for Queer Qoders. EllenMary will attend the meeting along with me and a Queer Qoder who just graduated during the upcoming intermission. I also reached out to Joanne regarding the trend of women and racial minorities repeating modules and dropping, and will discuss national higher ed trends and ways Turing can provide support to these populations with a Turing staff representative during the intermission.
