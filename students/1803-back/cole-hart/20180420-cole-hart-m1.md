# Cole Hart - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I aimed to become better at elemental Ruby language characteristics - storing data in different structures, understanding how to pass information between methods, classes and modules and becoming as comfortable as possible with the Turing educational environment.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the end of module assessment.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module, I learned how to:
- guide a developer along a command line interface in game form and in HTTP
- pull and organize data received from a server and HTTP request
- encode, decode and translate data between braille and English characters
- organize and provide business intelligence data analytics on customer and merchant transactional data for an Etsy-like site

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I completed the Braille to English encoder/decoder project, Night Writer, with Claire, meeting expectations from Mike's assessment and paired with Jude Dutton on the final prject, Black Thursday, where we received XXXXXXXX.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/colehart/night_writer
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/night_writer

##### Description
Create a CLI application that generates braille-like characters in a text file from an English message in a seperate text file. Support upper and lowercase characters and special characters.

##### Evaluation Comments
* Applicaton works
* Only uses default filenames
* watch the pattern where you're storing everything in ivars as opposed to having methods send and receive messages to each other
* make sure you are following the specification exactly as given
* comments will communicate why you made a choice, the code will explain how.

##### Scores
Ruby Syntax & Style: 3 - Meets expectations
- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [ ] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable  
- [ ] Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used sparingly)
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

Breaking Logic into Components: 3 - Meets expectations
- [ ] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 8 lines
- [ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

Test-Driven Development: 3 - Meets expectations
- [x] Each method is tested  
- [x] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [x] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)

Version Control: 3 - Meets expectations
- [x] Developer commits at a pace of at least 1 commit per hour
- [x] Developer implements branching and PRs
- [x] The final submitted version is merged into master

Functionality: 3 - Meets expectations
- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)

##### Feedback from Project Partner
"Cole is very patient and respectful. He is also very aware of what he does "right" and what he can do better or be better at. 
He is also very helpful and made sure that I understood what we were doing. 
I think what he can improve is making sure he does not dominate conversations as that could feel disempowering for some colleagues, but he is extremely aware of that and trying his best to not do it already. For example, at the evaluation for the project he did most of the talking mostly because he had a lot of questions and lot of things to say, which was fine with me. He made sure after our evaluation that I did not feel that he was disempowering me which I did not think it was the case (because I think it comes from our different personality and me being very quiet) but maybe other people could feel disempowered in a similar situation. 
So I think he is right to ask and pay attention to that."

## D: Professional Skills
I enjoyed the Professional Development sessions offered by Turing this mod. I learned My favorite were the "Code: Debugging the Gender Gap" session and the disucussion/slides on bias and impact vs intent in the feedback session. These sessions made me more aware of my professional identity and presence in professional environemnts, and how to leverage my perceived identity to create equitable environments and opportunities for as many folks as possible.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was a Student Advisory Board (SAB) representative of Mod 1 BEE this inning. I helped organize and man the social for the inning, the inning code fair, suggested a relationship/significant others of Turing support group that Joanne will be implementing with the help of alumnae couples next mod, and facilitated a meetup for Queer Qoders and the board chairperson of the local branch of a national LGBTQ non-profit to help find equitable and accepting work placement for Queer Qoders. EllenMary will attend the meeting along with me and a Queer Qoder who just graduated during the upcoming intermission. I also reached out to Joanne regarding the trend of women and racial minorities repeating modules and dropping, and will discuss national higher ed trends and ways Turing can provide support to these populations with a Turing staff representative during the intermission.
