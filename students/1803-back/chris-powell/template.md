# Christopher Powell - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to learn the fundamentals of object oriented
programming. By the end of the module I had achieved an approximate
70% understanding. I hope to achieve 100% understanding by repeating this
module.

(feedback to me)

Was an awesome time working with you and bouncing ideas back and forth,
and your researching skills on the problems we faced during the project
really helped us get unstuck.

Keep it up on working with those exercises to get more exposure to tests and
methods! With more practice on creating good, small tests; method creation will
become a second nature to you, and you'll be rocking it out in no time!

Thanks for your go-with-the-flow disposition! If there was a paradox of
"engaged while laid back", you'd be the living embodiment of it, and I really
jived with it. Hope you pair with you again in the future!

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I did not participate in very many community activities but I was very friendly
with my cohort and I believe I created a friendship with everyone. With people
who were at my level I was able to give advice and with people who were above me
their advice was easy to obtain.
