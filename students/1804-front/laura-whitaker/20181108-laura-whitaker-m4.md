### Questions

* **What was your biggest achievement of the module?**

	Learning and implementing React Native on our capstone project was a challenge that I feel had a rewarding end result. This module, I have really come to understanding that even though I didn’t know something doesn’t mean I don’t know anything. I still have work to do in regards to really owning that, but it didn’t prevent me from pursuing a problem as it has in the past.

* **What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?**

	Building off my answer to the previous question, I have really struggled with imposter syndrome throughout my time at Turing. Some days I feel super confident and others I question if I am really any good at this. I’ve learned that, like most things in life, being good as something doesn’t always mean doing it perfectly the first time.

* **What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?**

	I think I’ve been more willing to dive-in and learn new things. Being okay with being uncomfortable is something that I feel has allowed me to be more creative and inquisitive this module.

* **How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?**

	I really enjoyed learning back-end technologies… So much so, that it has made me question why I choose the front-end track. I am a visual learner, so the front-end appeals to that side of me. However, I also really enjoyed dealing with data and the logic of back-end technologies. I hope to continue learning more about it after Turing and I would love to try out Ruby or Python on a future project. It was really cool to build our own APIs and gain an insight into the one’s we’ve been using since Mod 2.

* **What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?**

	I know I may sound like a broken record here, but one of the most important skills I will take from Turing will be the ability to learn and ask questions, even if it makes me uncomfortable. I am also less afraid to ask questions and ask for help. Past experiences made me hesitant to reach out, but now I know I was just asking the wrong people and not to let a negative response keep me from seeking guidance.
