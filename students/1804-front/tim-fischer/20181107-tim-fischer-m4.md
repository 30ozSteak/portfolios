# Mod 4 Retrospective

Since the beginning Turing has reminded me of the feeling of being underwater. Each mod is a new dive into the unknown. A challenge to see how long I can hold my breath, how long can I persist? Intermissions are a short return to the surface. A brief visit to the world I will someday have to return to. 

I spent my young professional career working in the hospitality industry. I would usually begin an a starting position and work my way up until I reached the role I truly desired. While I was not without my accomplishments, I felt unchallenged and unfulfilled. 

After an extensive soul search a friend introduced me to programming. Through my own research I found it to be something that challenging me logically and allowed me to create something new out of nothing. Not long after hearing about Turing I decided it was the best path for me.

Each mod has had its share of struggles and victories. Mod 1 was an introduction to programming in general. A glance into design with a very thin slice of functionality. In Mod 2 we had a much deeper dive into JavaScript, the de facto language of web design and the first major roadblocks of unit testing.

Mod 3 revealed JavaScript to be a rabbit hole and React was the tea party on the other side. Libraries, frameworks and npm packages, oh my! JavaScript has its own endless tool belt and its all accessible via google. 

Mod 4 was a first look into the back end and the first opportunity to experience what it means to be a full stack developer. We also had the pleasure of working with two students from the other side of the mod, which was a great collaboration environment. 

Through out Turing my greatest struggle was, and will continue to be, imposture syndrome. Part of me wants to blame it on the fact that I have had the privilege of working with a team of extremely talented peers, but its also an issue I've lived with my whole life. Something that I can only work on everyday and hope to better except my accomplishments in the future.
