## Areas of Emphasis

This Mod I focused on areas of emphasis that would assist me in feeling technically prepared in a professional setting. While I would in no way consider myself an expert in any area specifically, I have learned to embrace what I felt were my bigger weaknesses and I now feel that I have grown the most in my self teaching abilities.
