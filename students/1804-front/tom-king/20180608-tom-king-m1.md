#### Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our only individual project that contained Javascript. The static comps we had to do were mainly html and css. For the number guesser project, we created a simple webpage layout for users that guess a number between 1 and 100. As you go further in the phases, there are more steps added in, for example, have the user specify the range themselves and not have it set to be 1 to 100. Our concentration in the static comp projects are to recreate a layout given to us, but while keeping the same structure. We also had to make the webpage responsive to all screen sizes.
