## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Projects

Individual Projects Include:

* Number Guesser
* Static Comp 1
* Static Comp 2
* Static Comp 3

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tomkingkong/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our only individual project that contained Javascript. The static comps we had to do were mainly html and css. For the number guesser project, we created a simple webpage layout for users that guess a number between 1 and 100. As you go further in the phases, there are more steps added in, for example, have the user specify the range themselves and not have it set to be 1 to 100. Our concentration in the static comp projects are to recreate a layout given to us, but while keeping the same structure. We also had to make the webpage responsive to all screen sizes.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

* Linked List
* Ideabox
* To Do Box Pivot

  * The group projects consisted of 3 paired programming assignments: Linked List, IdeaBox, and ToDoBox. Each project expanded on the previous and added new features requiring us to expand our javascript, jQuery, and html/css skills. The final paired project, ToDoBox, was an interesting exercise in which we were given another group's IdeaBox project and tasked with parsing, re-factoring, and adding new features to effectively pivot the IdeaBox to the ToDoBox theme without scraping the original code base.

Tom was very professional at every turn. Thank you for being patient with me when I was unclear about how some of the code was working. I learned so much from partnering with you.

#### IdeaBox

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

##### Evaluator: David Whitaker

##### Functional Expectations

* Proficient  The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

##### HTML

######  Accessibility

* Proficient  Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

###### Style

* Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

##### CSS

###### Structure of Code

* Proficient  Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

###### Implementation

* Proficient  Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

##### JAVASCRIPT

###### Data Types

* Proficient  Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

###### Conditional Logic

* Proficient  Can use an if/esle statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.

###### Functions & Scope

* Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.
* Proficient  Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

###### Arrays

* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.
* Proficient  Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.

###### Objects & Prototypes

* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

###### DOM Manipulation

* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

###### Style

* Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
* Proficient  Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

##### GIT & GITHUB

###### Git

* Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
* Proficient  Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

###### Github

* Advanced Beginner Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.
* Proficient  Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

##### DESIGN

###### Comp Recreation

* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

##### PAIRING

###### Collaboration

* Proficient  Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner’s learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta.

##### TERMINOLOGY

###### Technical Vocab

* Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.
