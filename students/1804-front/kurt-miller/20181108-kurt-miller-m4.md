# Post-Grad Job Search Action Plan Template: Your first 30 Days

## 30-Day Job Search Action Plan

### Create a schedule & goals for the first 30 days Post-Graduation

Design a 40-hour "work week" that provides time for:

- Code (ideally, 2-4 hours a day will be dedicated to coding)
- Outreach & Networking
- Job & company research and tracking
- Interview Prep
  *Housekeeping (refining your professional story, updating your resume, writing cover letters, updating your Turing portfolio, updating your LinkedIn profile)
  *Other (social networking, blogging, planning talks, etc.)
  \*Check-ins: who are you talking to and when?

How much time will you spend on each? When will you do each thing?

\*Spending 1 hour reaching out directly to recruiters, Turing alumni and/or my network (via email/inmail) (8:30am - 9:30am)

- Spending 3 hours each day strictly for coding (10am - 11:30am and 2:30pm - 4pm).
- Spending 3 - 5 hours each day on applying, research, cover letter drafting and networking (12pm - 2pm, any extra time).
- Spending 1 hour each day working out. (4:30pm - 5:30pm)
- Planning to check-in with Turing staff (i.e. Kayt, Ian at least once a week).

**Action Step #1:** Establish a shareable calendar (like Google Calendar) and block out time on your calendar _now_ to adhere to these goals. Be prepared to show this calendar to your instructors during your portfolio review.

**Action Step #2:** Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?

- I want to receive and sign an offer by New Year's.

**Action Step #3:** Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals to reach in order to reach your big goal:

##### Daily Goals

- Follow calendar outline consistently (i.e. working out consistently).
- Make commits every day (KEEP THOSE SQUARES GREEN!).
- Apply to 2-3 solid companies in Denver/Boulder every day (2 - 3 Cover Letters per day).
- Make 2-3 new connections on LinkedIn, or from the Turing network each day.

##### Weekly Goals

- Land 2-3 phone interviews each week.
  Attend a meetup every week / every other week.

* Check-in with Turing staff (Kayt, Ian, etc.) on a weekly basis.
* End of every week - Update job board based on success/rejection of opportunities.

##### Monthly Goals

- Land 4-5 in person interviews per month.
- End of month 1 - Have repo READMEs completely updated and projects completely fixed.
  -Continue to build upon these projects and make new projects.
- Begin to dive into Angular/ a new framework.
- Attend 2-3 meetups each month.
- Make 60-90 new connections a month.

Keep in mind:

- What is feasible in your schedule?
- What actions will give you the most impact in your search?

### Coding

For time spent coding during your first 30 days post-grad, consider:

- What skills would you like to improve or develop?
- Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up?
- Are there new languages or technologies you'd like to learn? How and when will you do that?

**Action Step:** Establish a “daily-practice” repository where you’ll put small daily exercises or work on issues from your own projects that you want to update to keep your skills sharp and your GitHub activity chart active. For your Mod 4 portfolio review, be prepared to describe to your instructors what you plan to work on to sharpen and advance your coding skills for the first 30 days of your job search.

### Outreach & Networking

As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking to stay on track during your first 30 days.

**Action Step #1:** Identify at least 3 individuals from companies you're tracking who could connect with during your first 30 days. Describe why you want to connect with these people and what you hope to talk about, when you will email them by, and what your follow-up will look like once you've met with them.

1. Kevin McKernan - AirDNA
   - I recently applied for a Front-End Engineer role at AirDNA and am trying to meet with Kevin to get his input on the company, as
     he is a Senior Software Engineer there and has plenty of experience.
2. Kelly Schroeder - DigitalGlobe
   - Kelly recently started at DigitalGlobe, but I want to get in contact with him to learn about his transition after Turing and how the
     strategies he put into place in order to get a job at DigitalGlobe, because it is one of my top companies.
3. David Tinianow - Vertafore
   - David is another Turing grad I want to stay in touch with, as he has already told me Vertafore is in the midst of a "hiring freeze" for the remainder of the year, but keeping in contact with him over the next month or two will increase my chances of landing an  
     opportunity at Vertafore.

**Action Step #2:** Find 3 new meetups or other career networking events to join during your first 30 days post-grad and describe why you'll attend those particular events. How will attending these meetups benefit you in your job search? How can you contribute to the community of these meetups? If you're interested in speaking at any of these meetups, describe how you'll connect with the organizers to arrange that and give a brief (2-3 sentences) pitch on what you might talk about and why.

1. React Meetup - Weekly
2. Develop Happy Hour - Weekly
3. Bootcampers Collective - Weekly
4. DenverScript - Monthly

- Attending these meetups will allow me to expand my network of connections and up my chances of getting my foot in the door for a Junior Developer role. I look forward to contributing to these meetups by actively participating at these meetups, answering any questions that I may know, asking questions that I don't know and speaking at a meetup over the next several months.

- Potential Meetup Talk - I plan on talking about the additions to React.js with the new React 16.6.0 release. I love building useful applications with React and have kept up to date with these new changes that have taken place in React 16.6 and think it would be highly beneficial for other developers to be aware about how some of these changes can make their lives easier and more efficient (especially if they use React on a daily basis).

### Job/Company Research & Tracking

Success in the job search means staying organized. The best way to do that is to have a clear system to keep track of your contacts, research, and updates on what you're doing.

**Action Step:** Show how you've set up [jobtrack.io](https://jobtrack.io/) to keep track of all your company/job outreach, who you talked to, what you learned, what next steps you'll take to follow-up, and anything you might do differently next time. Be prepared to describe this system to your instructors during your portfolio review.

- Because Jobtrack isn't going to exist soon, I'm using Excel to organize my job search.

### Interview Prep

During this module, you've had multiple opportunities to practice your technical and cultural interviewing skills. Think about how those experiences have helped you identify strengths and weaknesses in your interviewing skills.

**Action Step:** Identify 2-3 areas you'd like to continue to improve on for interviewing and outline concrete action steps on how you will improve those skills. If you plan on setting up more mock interviews, identify who you will set those up with and by what date.

1. Technical Code Challenge

- CodeWars/Exercisms.
- Meeting with classmates to whiteboard.
- CodeSignal Interview Prep.

2. Technical Questions - Verbal explanation

- Meetup with classmates and roleplay.
- Continue to take online tutorials.
- Reading Material (i.e. A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms by Jay Wengrow)

### Housekeeping

Make sure you have all your job search components up-to-date and looking their best!

**Action Step #1:** Ensure your [Turing Portfolio](https://alumni.turing.io) has **at least 3 projects displayed,** including your latest work, and an accurate list of your desired locations. Be prepared to show this to your instructors during your M4 portfolio review.

**Action Step #2:** Ensure your LinkedIn is up to date and indicates that you’re job hunting. Indicate here a summary of any adjustments you made and how you'll continue to update it and/or use the site to build your network and online presence.

### Other

What other areas would you like to focus on during your job search? Some possible ideas include:

- Social Networking
- Blogging
- Planning and submitting meetup and/or conference talks
- Participating in hackathons or open source projects

**Action Step:** Identify one of the areas above or an additional area that you'd like to develop further during your first 30 days post-grad and be prepared to discuss this with your instructors at your portfolio review.

- I plan on discussing expanding my network via Social Networking and attending meetups and dually expanding my network that way.

### Check-ins: Who are you talking to and when?

Accountability is key during a job search and being able to check in with a person whom you trust (or, ideally, more than one person) on your progress will increase your ability to reach your goals in the timeline you've created.

**Action Step:** Identify 1-2 people you'll check in with during your first 30 days post-grad. Consider how you might continue to utilize your PD Peer Groups. Describe why you will check in with this person, how you will check in with them, what you aim to talk about, and what you hope to get out of these check-ins to benefit your job search.

- I Plan on checking in with Brandon Fiebiger, other classmates as well to discuss the job search. I also plan on utilizing my PD Peer Group in order to discuss potential strategies for succeeding in the job search. Plan on checking in with Brandon once every week via screenshare or in person in Denver; I plan to either practice answering interview questions with him and talking about strategies moving forward.

### Identifying & Overcoming Barriers

While you've made concrete plans for how to achieve your goal, it's also important to take stock of what could hold you back in the job search.

**Action Step:** Identify 1-2 "barriers" you might put on yourself in this job search as well as the steps you will take to overcome them. Be prepared to describe these in your M4 portfolio review.

##### Potential Barriers

    1) Rejection - Use my past experiences and motivation to keep moving forward. Dwelling for too long on being rejected from a company does nothing in the long run.

    2) My Breadth of Knowledge - Might hinder my ability to be confident in interviews. I just need to keep practicing coding, reading, whiteboarding, etc. to gain more confidence when the interview comes. Turing is one of the most rigorous immersive coding programs out there and I shouldn't be worried moving forward in the job search.
