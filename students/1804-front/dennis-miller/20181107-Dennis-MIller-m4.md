# What was your biggest achievement of the module?
My biggest achievement for the module was simply completing it. I have been consistently stressed out about projects and passing each mod, but this mod all the stress that has been piling up really took a toll on me. I did not expect to be this mentally/physically exhausted, but by pushing through and completing everything I really found out what I am capable of. Turing has been the hardest thing I have ever done, but I'm positive from what I have learned and the sacrifices that I made will lead me to where I want to be in life.

# What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
Being exhausted mentally and physically was my biggest struggle. There were times I noticed myself sturggling to do normal day tasks. At one point in the mod I considered just not completing a project because of how tired and fustrated I was. From this I learned that in order to get where I want to be I have to be willing to do whatever it takes. "Nothing worth having comes easy" and for the first time in my life I really understood that quote.

# What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
Nothing to be honest!

#How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
By learning a little bit of backend this mod, it made me want to go deeper in to it. I would like to try and learn some of the backend languages, having knowledge of the backend would set me apart from others.

# How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
It connected everything together for me. When we first had to interact with the backend in mod 3 I had no idea what was going on, and now I know the basics of how a backend works enough to be able articulate answers or questions when talking about it.

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
From Turing making most projects team projects I think it has made me more prepared to work in a team environment. Wether it was a positive experience or negative one I was exposed to situations where as a team we had to work through issues to get to our main goal. 

# 30 day action plan

## Calendar

## Cut off date
I would love to have a job within a month but the realistic cut off would be 60 days max.
 
## List of daily, weekly and monthly goals
Daily stick with my 30 day plan and complete my daily assignments.
weekly have a set number of resumes sent out 
monthly have at least a few interviews

## Daily practice repo 
https://github.com/dmiller1623/daily-practice

## 3 people to reach out to
Julie Duresma
Darin Manica

## 3 meetups to go to 
 1. React Denver - I really love react but i feel like there is so much more to learn. And aslo a good place to network.
 2. Node.js meetup in boudler - Would like to learn mor about the backend and I think it would set me appart from others to know how to fully use Node.js
 3. Rocky Mtn. Angular - I've noticed a lot of jobs requirng an Angular backgorund so i think this will be my first choice of language to learn outside of Turing.
 
## Job tracking system 
I have jobtrack but haven't really been using it yet

##List 2-3 areas you'd like to continue to improve on for interviewing and outline concrete action steps on how you will improve those skills to describe to instructor(s)
I want to improve on my coding challenges. I will be using code wars and leetcode to practice each day in the morning.
Also want to go back and review most technical terms so when going in to interviews I will feel more prepared when asked technical questions.

## List 1 to 2 people to check in with for job search
Kayt and Jeff or EllenMary

## 1 -2 barriers to overcome 
I need to get better at cold outreach and keeping in touch. In order to get better at this I plan on just reaching out to as many people as I can.
