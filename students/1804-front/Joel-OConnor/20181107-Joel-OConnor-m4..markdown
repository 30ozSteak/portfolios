# Joel O'Connor - M4 Portfolio

## What was your biggest achievement of the module?

I came to have a deeper understanding of how the frontend and backend work together. This really brought everything I learned at Turing together and helped to shine some light on parts of the programing environment that in the previous mods were mysterious and unknown.
Example: I used API’s before but never really understood exactly what happened on the other side after I submitted a fetch. It just seemed like magic that resulted in some data being sent back to me.

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

My biggest struggle this mod was balancing my health while still being a contributing team member and making sure to learn all I could about building full stack applications. This really taught me how to overcome a difficult situation on a whole different level than I’ve ever experienced. This also showed me that even when everything feels like it’s falling apart giving up is never an option and keep pushing forward till things workout.

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

This inning I juggled my job search and class work to a larger extent than part of the class.

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

I think it will be really fun once I have more experience in the industry to dive into some backend programming languages.

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Confidence that I have the problem solving skills to overcome any task I am faced with in a job. Turing also gave me the tools to understand how I can teach myself anything in programming and beyond.
