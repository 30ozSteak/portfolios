# What was your biggest achievement of the module?
* Learning webscraping with Nightmare.js and focused on Knex.js, Express.js, and Vue.js

# What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
* Juggling Turing projects and job search. I learned a balance of life!

# What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
* I learned to use skill in patience and skills in my mindfulness training in accepting the present moment and non-attachment.

# How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
* I learned the difference in the two programs and i thinka n inherent discipline between both the languages and frameworks we were taught. Im glad we were exposed to the backend a bit earlier.

# What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
 * Learning to learn. I thinkthis is the gretest gift that was given adn taught. I now have the confidence that given a concept or language i dont know, that I wouldn't be that threatened by its introduction or presentation to me.
