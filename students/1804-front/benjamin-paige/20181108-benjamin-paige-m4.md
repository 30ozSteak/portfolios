# Module 4 Portfolio Presentation

## Benjamin Paige

---

* What was your biggest achievement of the module?

I think the biggest achievement of the mod was not necessarily the coding that I did but the job prep that i accomplished. I feel very comfortable with my upcoming job search and this mod has definitely helped me immensely with that.  

* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

The capstone was the biggest struggle of the mod. Determining all of the details between how the data should be exchanged and the overall json contract details tought me that planning is incredibly important in these projects. 

* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

I dont know enough about the work of my peers to answer that.

* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

It was great to gain a better understanding of the back end and see how FE and BE work together. In the future, I'd like to call myself a fullstack engineer.

* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?

Real knowledge is knowing you know nothing. - socrates.
