# Paul Kim - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This being the first module, I was determined to start strong and develop a good foundational understanding of introduction front-end programming material in order to be successful in following mods.  Although there is endless information to learn, I feel i've developed a solid, driven work ethic to learn as much as i can everyday.

# Number Guesser
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sojurner/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

### Description
Javascript along with DOM Manipulation to create number guessing game.  User specifies a minimum number and a maximum number:

* If guess is less than the random number; will indicate that number is too low
* If guess is greater than the random number; will indicate that the number is too high
* If guess is out of the specified ranges; will return and error.

A correct guess, will increment the minimum and maximum range by ten and generate a new random number.

### Notes/What To Work On:

HTML
* Use forms! Use aria-labels!
* Switch to kabob-case

CSS
* use classes as standalone in declaration
* pull duplicate declaration blocks into a more broad class to dry things up
* May be easier to use percentages as widths

JS
* Leverage else ifs - always have an else for the catch all
* be more verbose and descriptive in naming conventions
* leverage console logs more and know what returns are doing (they will return a value from a function, and are only really necessary if we want to store the return value

FeedBack from Partner, Thomas Scully:

````
Your continued dedication and hard work throughout the project was admirable and definitely kept us on track. Clearly articulating why and how your code functions will help future partners, in addition to following the standard Git flow while on a team.

# IdeaBox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sojurner/Idea-Box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)



Focus of the Project was to create a page that captures Ideas through user input.  Vanilla javascript was used to implement the functionality below.

For each Idea the user submits, a card is created that provides the function to:

    * Delete Specific Cards
    * Up/Down Arrows to toggle importance value [Swill, Plausible, Genius] 

A long list of ideas can be filtered to display a desired idea through the search box.

In addition, local storage is utilized to maintain and remove user information on page reload.  As for client-side interface, responsiveness and appropriate styling was expected.


## Notes/What To Work On:

* Excellent comp implementation

### HTML
* Great use of aria-labels
* Make sure you're pulling in fonts and scripts correctly

### CSS
* Consider adding organizational comments 
* Leverage more broad class rules for maintainability

### JS
* When refactoring, Look for duplication, pull out into its own function and pass dynamic info as arguments
* Work on naming conventions, tell a story

# 2DoBox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sojurner/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

## Description
A pivot from the IdeaBox project.  Inherited an existing codebase and refactored to limit duplication and remove unnecessary code while maintaining its overrall integrity/identity.  

In addition to IdeaBox features:

    * Importance quality now has 5 ratings [Critical, High, Normal, Low, None]
    * Option to check marked as done; will hide card on page reload
    * Option to show marked cards.
    * Filter cards based on importance quality

## Notes/What To Work On:

Functional
Partial phase 3, through importance

UI
Make input text different color from placeholder text
remove quotes around body
Show completed items, should have completed class

ARIA
all interactive elements should have an aria-label

HTML
Be careful with elements with only one child
use cdn version of jquery

GIT
Make sure to use imperative present voice, be more descriptive with description

JS
Make sure you are using parameters in your functions, e.g. IdeaCard id parameter

# D: Professional Skills
Professional Skills are probably my weakest points. I have an issue on focusing too much on academia and not enought on professional development. To me, this was an area I felt Turing would help me improve drastically in and so I've approached all gear-ups seriously.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness

    * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Any skill or trade requires work-life balance in order to be successful. Implementing a balance lifestyle opens doors to a cascade of benefits that positively affect us on multiple levels.  Exercise, proper nutrition, meditation, pomadores, and adequate sleep all reset our physiological meter and enable us to be more effective each day.  Recently, I have begun to take nutrition seriously and have implemented time-restricted eating + high fat/low carb diet. While the long-term effects are yet to be determined, I have definitely felt an immediate difference in mental performance as I am more focused and not as easily distracted. 
 
#### Code 2.0

    * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

As an Asian American growing up in California, I was surrounded by the concept of inclusivity, diversity and the gender gap in the U.S. workforce.  So I agree with many of the issues addressed in the video. I think all people deserve the oppurtunity to follow their passion and not be bogged down by societal pressures.  Desipite women having many unique strengths and so many things to offer, its a shame that a gender gap exists in the tech industry. I am very grateful for the all oppurtunies that i've had to be successful and happy and those oppurtunities were possible because of an all-inclusive and diverse environment. 

#### Bio-hacking
    
    * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1804inning/biohacking.md)

Bio-hacking encompasses a multitude of categories as mentioned in the presentation. I am naturally drawn to nutrition and fitness and so the one particular category that intrigued me was on nutrigenomics presented by Joseph. He mentioned the consumption of probiotics to maintain proper gut flora and how it ties with our mental performance and overrall physiological health.  Growing up I ate Kimchi, but stopped consuming it when I left home.  After the gear-up I went straight to a local asian market and bought a jar of Kimchi.  He also mentioned the effects of a low carb/high fat diet and how it mimics the fasting state up to 70%.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Despite being an extreme introvert, I've made a conscious effort to participate in group study sessions.  While group discussions/sessions aren't a strength of mine, I thrive in one on one tutoring and have always took the time to help anyone who approaches me with questions. 

I make my way to Turing every weekend to study and collaborate with peers to bridge any personal gaps in knowledge, and help others do the same.
