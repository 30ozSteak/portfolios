## Reflections

- What was your biggest achievement of the module?

  - The training wheels finally came off this mod. Throughout my time at Turing, I have impatiently waited for my aha moment. This is referring to the point where I no longer struggle solving problems on my own and can effectively develop alone, with very minimal or no help from others.After my first few weeks at Turing, I realized achieving this could only be done through struggle and perseverance. Coming to the end, I finally have the confidence to call myself a developer thanks to the efforts of my instructors and classmates.

- What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?

  - Becoming self sufficient was the biggest struggle for me at Turing. My whole life, being the youngest of three children, Iâ€™ve always had someone around to help me when I struggled. Teaching myself to suffer and struggle instead of reaching out for help at the first sign of trouble was a big turning point for me.

- What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

  - Finally catching up to the rest of my peers as far as development skills are concerned has finally allowed my softer skills to shine. My reasoning for entering the realm of software development was to find a technical skill that I could pair with my person to person sales experience. By finally reaching a similar level of development proficiency to my peers, I can now set myself apart with the skills that are not so easily learned. I am hopeful that this will lead to a shorter and more effective job hunt, as well as foster my future prospects by being a valued software development team member.

- How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students)impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

  - Overall, I really enjoyed learning about the backend this mod. Do I want to focus on the backend going forward? No. Is it a good thing to have experience with? Yes. It was very helpful to finally be able to understand how the backends we are fetching data from are structured.

- What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
  - Over the course of my 7 months at Turing, I realized that being the best/fastest/most clever developer doesn't directly correlate to success in the real world. Working well with others and being accepting of feedback/criticism is far more important to personal development and professional success than just writing perfect code in the fastest manner possible. I wasn't always put on teams where we all saw eye to eye, but learning effective strategies to move the team forward and accomplish objectives.
