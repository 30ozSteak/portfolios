# Michael Lyons - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for mod 3 was to survive. Going into it, I knew the workload was going to be heavy and the subject matter complex compared to the previous mods. Overall, mod3 was my favorite at turing thus far. During mod 3 I out in a massive amount of effort in order to solidify my skills. I made it a goal to be as accessible as possible to the mod2 FE/BE students whenever they needed assistance.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we worked on 2 projects individually. They were a Headcount 2.0 application and a personal project, FlamesFinder.

#### Headcount 2.0

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/headcount-2.0)
- [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

Headcount 2.0 is an application designed to take in data from a public schools API and render cards of that data with React. You can view cards of specific school data, compare districts, and search for districts.

#### FlamesFinder

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/flames-finder-client)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/red-green-blue.html)

FlamesFinder is dynamic application that allows for users to find nearby campgrounds via geoLocation. Once a current location has been given, a list of the 20 closest campgrounds is displayed along with a map showing their proximity. From there the user can select a campground and be taken to a page with the campground info displayed along with the current and future weather displayed.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In Groups we built some cool applications this mod, and in this section, I will showcase SWAPI-box and MovieTracker.

#### SWAPI-box

- [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/ml-gs-swapAPI-Box)
- [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPI-box Box is dynamic single page application that lets users interact with data from the Star Wars API in order to brush up on their favorite characters, planets, and vehicles. Users can save their favorite items for later viewing, as well as read random intro movie quotes at the bottom of the screen.

MovieTracker is working off the The Movie DB API. The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. This is our first dive into redux and testing redux.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During this module, I tried to continue integrating myself into the Turing Community as much as possible. I was a weekly leader of Iron-FE, attended a codeFair, showed up for a Denver tech meet-up, and had a generally capital time.
