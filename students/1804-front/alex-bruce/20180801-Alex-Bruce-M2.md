# Alex Bruce - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to gain a better understanding of the intricacies of JavaScript, learn ES6 and React, and improve my overall understanding of front-end development

## B: Individual Work & Projects



#### (Complete-Me)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/complete-me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

Complete-Me was a project meant to give an introduction to prefix tries and to create an autocomplete system, which would later be implemented in Weathrly. It was an interesting way to visualize and create a relatively complex data structure.

Evaluation comments: Struggled with talking through thought process/articulation without reverting back to code. More pracitce with whiteboarding would be good

Evaluation scores:
- Process: 2.75
- Fundamental JS & style: 3
- TDD & Code Sanitation: 2.75
- functional expectations: 3

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Both of the two group projects this module were created to focus on multiple newly learned aspects of development for the students. They also helped with our skills of working together in groups, 

#### (Game-Time)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Game-Time was an introductory project for HTML Canvas and ES6 syntax, as well as a deeper dive into object oriented JavaScript than we had really seen before, especially when considering the new class/constructor structure introduced with ES6. With my project in particular, Laura and I created Frogger.

Evaluation notes:
- Both articulated their knowledge of classes/OOP very well
- Little too many things in the index.js that could be moved into the Game class but overall classes seemed well-structured and they each had appropriate methods and instance properties on them

Evaluation scores:
- Function Expectations: 3.5
- User Interface: 3.5
- Testing: 3
- JS Style and OOP: 3

Feedback to me:
- Don't autoplay music
- give more emphasis on the game/less on instructions
- keep track of lives

#### (Weathrly)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/kmiller9393/weathrly)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Weathrly was our first project where we used React. It was made to show us the power of components, class, props, and general React syntax. It also gave us a look at API fetch calls, by pulling in live weather data to make a functional web weather application.

Evaluation comments and scores are still pending

## D: Professional Skills

PD Session Gists

#### (Agile Reflection)
I thought it was really interesting to see the different methodologies for development, as well as the pros and cons of each one. I've used the principles of agile development actively quite a bit this mod, and even inadvertently last mod. Each project we've worked on has provided an opportunity for this, even if it's on a small scale. For example, in a paired project, if I'm working on a feature, I can test it and implement new code, push it to GitHub, and wait for feedback from my partner about how the feature looks and operates. Based on their feedback, I can go back to the drawing board to improve working code or fix broken code. I believe this is the best way to build an effective project. I plan to continue to use these practices in Mod 3, 4, and in the workplace.

#### (In Person Feedback Conversation Reflection)
I've spoken with my partners for both paired projects this mod. We kept the conversations fairly relaxed and casual, while still taking it seriously. For my last talk with Kurt Miller, we spoke on Friday. The conversation went well. We talked about most aspects of working together. It wasn't very difficult because I was very pleased with Kurt's effort on this project. So I didn't really need to give much criticism. Typically my biggest challenge is figuring out how to give constructive criticism in a way that's both fair and kind to them, and still gets my point across. Overall I think I have a good ability to talk to people. I'm typically able to convey my thoughts in an unbiased way, and I think that's made it easy to be open with people


#### (Working Draft of Professional Story)
When I first learned about the existence of Turing, I was looking for a shift. It wasn't really a career shift because what I was doing didn't really count as a career. But I was looking for a shift into a career. I've always been fascinated by technology, and on a larger level, how things work. As an example, I've always loved cars, and especially the science and logic needed to build one or make one work. This love for gaining a mechanical understanding of things was what drew me to Turing.
My mom works in education, and through a series of connections related to her, I learned about Turing. Once I began experimenting with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was hooked. I needed to know more about it, and more importantly, I wanted to seize an opportunity. I finally felt like there was something that I was interested in that could lead to a fulfilling career.


#### (Plan for outreach and networking in M3)
By the end of Mod 3 I would like to reach out to multiple people as part of my networking plan. I would like to speak with my mentor, as well as at least one person I don't personally know yet. I would like to meet with people in a fairly casual setting like a coffee shop to get to know them and network myself. I think that I can bring a lot to the table in a setting like that. If I'm meeting with somebody I don't know yet, this type of setting could be good for getting to know them, and giving them an opportunity to know me, even before they see what I can do technically. I think a strong personal foundation can be immensely valuable to building professional relationship. I have had a few people in the tech industry reach out already through connections with people I know, saying that they'd like to get to know me. I would like to reach out and create connections that way.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I tried very much to support and be active in the Turing community this mod. I paired often with mod 1 students, including on weekends. I made a point to be available to help them as much as my schedule allowed. I also offered help, support, and advice whenever possible to my own cohort.  I spent much more time outside of class with my cohort than I had before, both doing school work, and socially. This is something I've struggled with before because of my introverted nature. I felt that it was important to get to know my cohort, not only to have a network of friends going into the same field as me, but also for support. Near the end of this mod I've finally started to feel like I have a group of people I can go to if I have questions or concerns about school work.
