## Areas of emphasis:
This mod I set out to increase my understanding of JavaScript and React fundamentals, as well as learn new things like Redux.

### HeadCount 2.0
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/headcount2.0)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

The first project this module was HeadCount, which takes a look at manipulating and cleaning large amounts of incoming data for the purpose of making them usable in a React application. For the most part I enjoyed being able to use concepts I had learned previously like array prototype methods to manipulate data before pulling them into components.


### Apex
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/Personal-Project-M3)

The final project for Mod 3 is the Binary Challenge, where a student is given an API and an intended audience. The API I used is Taste Dive, which recommends movies, tv shows, music, books, authors, and games based on search queries, while my intended audience was motorsports super-fans. The application is called Apex. This was my toughest project in terms of the tech stack and time given. Because I was sick partway through the mod and missed learning about Redux, I began the project on the wrong foot, with a much less-than-ideal understanding of Redux. I was able to make it work though, and turn in a functioning application that recommends media for motorsport enthusiasts.

### SWapi-Box
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/SWapiBox)
[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWapi-Box utilized the Star Wars API to pull down data and display characters, planets, and vehicles from the movies onto a page using React and React Router. It was meant to further strengthen understanding of APIs and React, with a fun topic.

### Movie Tracker
[Github Repo](https://github.com/Alexbruce1/movie-tracker)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

Movie Tracker was the first project to implement Redux. It, again, pulled API data into an application, but this time used Redux to store information, and displayed movies with an interface similar to what would be seen on Netflix or Hulu.

## E: Community Participation

This module I set out to get to know my cohort better. I made an effort to not only have lunch with them more, but also spend time pairing. This was extremely beneficial to me. I got better at asking for help when I needed it, as well as helping other students out when they needed it. 

## Outcome 

Pass with Concern.... got sick during the mod and missed a few critical days, but think he can put in the extra work to get caught up
