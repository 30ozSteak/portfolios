## Areas of Emphasis

Hello again.
This mod was a fun one. A week into intermission a mod1 student messaged me on slack asking about what I knew about grid, and if I could help them leverage it for Turing / Personal projects. A short time later I'm known as a css obsessionist and I've got pairings 7 hours a week.
But I really enjoyed it.
Like with mod1 (and what I said in my m1 review md), my biggest emphasis here at Turing has remained involving myself with the community. Teaching a tool I had just learned / got somewhat good at seemed to propel me in that area. I'm not sure how many pairings / total hours I spent here helping 'my juniors' with something I was somewhat good at, but it felt good and I went home at the end of the day feeling accomplished and recharged.

I really wanted to have a better grasp on array prototypes by the end of the mod, but the 'big picture' for me didn't sink in as soon as I hoped it would. I came through on all of our projects despite the challenges they presented, but at the end of the day, I should have a better understanding of some of the material than I do.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Did not pass. I am not as far along in my understanding of array prototypes as I would have hoped, and feel like I'd benefit more from a second shot at mod2 before going onto 3.
