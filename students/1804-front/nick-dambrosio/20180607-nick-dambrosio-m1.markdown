# (Nick Dambrosio) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I want to become more familiar with HTML and CSS, but I really want to dive deep onto JS. There's a lot of really cool things that can be done with the language, and I want to gain as much as I can from it. I really also want to experience a community like I haven't before. I want to reach out when I need it most and embrance not knowing things.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I learned / heard about CSS grid about 5 - 6 months ago and it looked fun, but incredibly daunting. I decided that once I started Turing I would try to devote a little extra time to learning Grid and all the wonderful things it can do. I used it for all three static comps and it made an incredible difference between what I was capable of doing before and what I can do now. 


#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

To build a number guessing game that takes user input and returns a message based on that input

#comments
Functionality through phase 4 Love the multiplayer

HTMLS Avoid using BR small formatting

CSS Remove padding from body

JS organize variable declarations at top by type

#### (Static Comp 1)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/nd-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

To build a static site based off a pre-existing design as a way to test out HTML / CSS.

#comments
I really enjoyed learning about making div's daisy chain off of a hover event from another divs, causing a style change on a DIFFERENT div. It was really exciting to learn something that most no one had experimented with before. Would have been easier using Javascript, and I shouldn't have wasted time struggling with getting an idea of what to do the static comp on. I also should have optimized my images instead of expecting 300mb gifs to work properly.

#### (Static Comp 2)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/nd-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

To build a static site based off a pre-existing design as a way to test out HTML / CSS.

Dogs! I didn't have nearly as hard of a time with static comp2 as I did with SC1 because I planned out the project beforehand. I knew I was going to use grid on the cards-section, and I knew I was going to do the project on Max Fund, the same shelter I got my dog at, so I was able to knock this out pretty early and focus entirely on 2DoBox paired project.

Poor time management all around! I finished up ToDo Box pretty early and decided to sink all my remaining time into studying Mythical Creatures and prepare for thge DOM challenge. definitely a mistake that I paid for in the end as it wasn't as responsive as it should have been. I revisted this within a few hours of turning it in (and taking a nap) and was able to refactor and clean it up using Grid. Much better the second time around.

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/LinkedList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Our first paired project saw us taking user inputs and appending them to a part of the page and was the first time most everyone worked with template literals. Fun stuff, but having a strong partner made it a much more enjoyable experience. We had some pretty novice mistakes with out handling of Github, but nothing that actually caused any problems

#comments

HTML

Use aria labels on inputs!
CSS

Pull duplicate declarations into their own class. ie. border-bottom
Consider using more organizational comments
Lots of inconsistencies - look at the style guides!
JS

Lots of inconsistencies with indentation and semicolons - look at the style guides!
Could be a bit more descriptive with naming conventions


## C: Group Work & Projects

#### (IdeaBox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Thomas was a really powerful partner in this project. We spent hours on and off campus working together on different parts of the project and making sure the other understood it fully. It's a shame that he's moved on to other things.

For the project itself we had to get an ideaBox with local storage going on and we didn't crack that egg until the second to last day. 

#comments

Able to make blank cards on page load
Quality does not persist
No search or content editable
Looks great!!!
Look into handling overflow from the cards differently so that cards maintain consistency in height

#### (2DoBoxPivot)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imsteaky/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

2DoBox Pivot saw us taking a pre-existing project, written by someone else entirely, and refactoring / improving it to meet new standards. It was a in interesting experience taking someone elses code and understanding how it works and how you could refactor it.

#comments

Functional Partial phase 3, through importance
UI Make input text different color from placeholder text remove quotes around body Show completed items,should have completed class
ARIA all interactive elements should have an aria-label
HTML Be careful with elements with only one child use cdn version of jquery
GIT Make sure to use imperative present voice, be more descriptive with description
JS Make sure you are using parameters in your functions, e.g. IdeaCard id paramete

(feedback to me)

## D: Professional Skills
Telling a proper story is essential and working on a way to spin mine into a positive light has something I've always struggled with. Not only do I generally feel that my story isn't worth hearing at times, but also that it's much better told from a point of struggle and my failures along the way (as thee are maaaanny). Putting everything in a positive light is something I'll have to continue working towards throughout my time here.

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health 101)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

Tackling mental health can be tricky. I for one have experienced struggles with it throughout my adult life, and know that it's something shouldn't be taken lightly. Hopefully by building a strong community here at Turing knowing that this is an opportunity to learn and grow will help improve my success here, and prevent any problems stemming from lack of confidence or stress from things that... generally don't deserve me mentally wasting brainspace to.

#### (Code Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

My previous career saw me in a very male-focused position being in a combat unit in the Army. We didn't have any women assigned to my part of the unit until 2010 or so, and that was a very drastic and sudden change. It was a really interesting experience and shattered a lot of norms / beliefs that women should be sticking to certain roles in their careers. It's a shame this is still a thing in tech eight years later (It's a shame it's a thing anywhere, period, but still.) As a white heteronormative male, it's my responsibility to ensure the inclusivity of everything I do to try and remove these pre-exiting beliefs about gender/race roles.

#### (You Probably Won't Come To This Session, You'd Rather Be Working On Your Project)

* [GitHub URL](missing)

Hooboy. Once the Pentathalon started I was finally hit with the stress bus over managing my time / energy properly and making sure things got completed on time and if I'd be able to move on the mod2 / if I'd be successful at all here. Most (all) of this was me unnecessarily getting inside my head, and it was apparent how ineffective it was at motivating me to get things done on time. I'm really glad I got to go to this session, because it gave me the chance to open up to other people in a samilar space as me and let me talk about the things that have been bothering me, effectively removing them. I would highly suggest going to this gear up again.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

My biggest goal with coming to Turing (outside of coding) has definitely been embracing the community here, and I think I've done that incredibly well. I've spend the last 3-4 years at my previous job fairly isolated, and living in a fairly isolated area, so getitng to work well with others was my biggest focus. I think I've done this incredibly well so far, and I thorougly enjoy working with classmates from different mods / programs and trying to understand their approach.
