# Maria St. Louis-Sanchez - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for mod 1 were: Learn the foundations of JavaScript, challenge myself to always be learning and being open to other solutions, grow in my HTML and CSS skills and throw myself into the life of a developer. While the mod has been challenging, I'm proud of how much I've learned in just six weeks and have loved the challenge and the excitment of finally figuring out a tough solution.
