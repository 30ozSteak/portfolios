### HeadCount
* [Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)
* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/jdursema/HeadCount2.0)

Headcount was a project using a messy set of data that we had to clean and then display using React. This project also helped sharpen our React skills.

Specification Adherence
3 - The application completes all 5 iterations.
Code Quality
3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.
CSS/Design
3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.
Testing
4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested
PropType Implementation
Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.
Code Sanitation
The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints
Workflow
3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

### Swapi-Box
* [Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)
* [GiHub Pages](https://github.com/patrickjneel/swapi-box)

Swapi-Box was really fun project using the Star Wars API and working with asynchronous API calls. We were introudced to async await and seemed to make our lives much easier. We also used React on this project to further hone our skills with React.

#### Comments

Evaluator:Christie
Students:
Comments: Separate fetch calls into separate functions - will make them much easier to test. Make sure that you are not actually making the fetch call in your test, and instead using a jest.fn(). Move all your mock data to a separate file. Overall, nice job on this project!

Workflow
4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

### Movie-Tracker
*[Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)
* [GiHub Pages](https://github.com/JorgeEdPerezGa/movie-tracker)

This project was extremely difficult. Luckily I had soild project partners and we were able to pull it off. This was the first project with Redux and React-Router. We used a moviedb API to pull the movie database info. And create users and sign in and show favorties. It was very hard, but I learned a lot.

3 - Five or fewer complaints
Redux Architecture
3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
Routing
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Personal Project
*[Original Assessment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)
* [GiHub Pages](https://github.com/patrickjneel/Summit-County-Precincts-)

A solo self directed project that was tough and very daunting project. I did mine on precinct info in Summit County that would display info when a user input their address and show a marker of thier location and the data that pertains to their address that corresponds to the precinct.

#### Comments

### Community Participation
I helped out with when I could or people had questions from lowers mods. I also assisted with a few back-end students with helping with CSS questions. Lastly I attended a few guest speakers throughout the mod.

### Professional Development

#### Story Telling 4
We refined working on our story and telling people

#### Resume Workshop
We made a resume and had a staff memeber review them of where they needed to be refined.
