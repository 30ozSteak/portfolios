# Todd Watner - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Being entirely new to programming in any manner, I set out to accomplish a great deal. My main goal of beginning to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript was achieved through the design of the curriculum, good instruction, and hard work. I was proud to succeed when I did, and proud to learn from my many failures. Other goals of mine, like meeting great people and networking, have been accomplished as well. Going forward, I aim to advance my skills in Javascript, learn new languages, and intensely network.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Through the pre-work, books, and lessons to the static comps, number guesser project and online resources, I had an amazing time learning this past mod. These individual projects truly tested my ability to code.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Toddsteez/tw-number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project was very difficult for me. I had missed a very important class which had introduced key Javascript concepts. This project was the beginning of my mod-long chase. However, this project was a strong start to my learn coding career and ultimately enjoyed it. Pairing was clutch!

Besides improving javascript (common theme), I needed to consider a difficult user by making my limitations strict.

#### Static Comps

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Toddsteez/tw-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Toddsteez/tw-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

The static comps were very challenging because I had little experience using HTML and CSS. The main challenges were page layout and how to breakdown HTML efficiently/correctly, working with flex and other strange CSS things, and making time to successfully complete them.
