# Todd Watner - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Being entirely new to programming in any manner, I set out to accomplish a great deal. My main goal of beginning to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript was achieved through the design of the curriculum, good instruction, and hard work. I was proud to succeed when I did, and proud to learn from my many failures. Other goals of mine, like meeting great people and networking, have been accomplished as well. Going forward, I aim to advance my skills in Javascript, learn new languages, and intensely network.
