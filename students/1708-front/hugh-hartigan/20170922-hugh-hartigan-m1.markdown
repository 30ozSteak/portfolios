# Hugh Hartigan - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main point of focus this module was to refine my general understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JS spoke to one another. I had a very, *very* basic understanding of how it worked, but not until I was thrown head first into coding did I really start to understand how truly complicated and intricate the languages were. Each language has their ups and downs, but a firm understanding of each one is crucial to being a front end developer. Initially, I thought I had a good handle on HTML and CSS, wanting to focus more on JS, but with each project, I learned more about HTML and CSS and what made them unique and how expertly I needed to know each language to fully utilize the full potential of tham all. While I certainly haven't mastered even one of the languages, my appreciation for how the each communicate to one another has deepened and made me more interested in each one. For HTML, I want to know more about ARIA and basic structuring tricks. For CSS, I want to learn how to animate, transform, and transition to make something amazing. And for JS, I want to more intimately understand it's limitations, but also how I can creatively use it's flexibility to my advantage.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

During Mod 1 at Turing, my required individual projects were *Number Guesser* and *Static Comps 1-3*. 

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL](https://hartiganhm.github.io/hh-comp-challenge-1/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

In repurposing *Static Comp 1*, I used Rick Sanchez from the TV show Rick and Morty as my subject. Overall, it's a mock-version of the traditional artist's portfolio website, consisting of tabs for Planets Destroyed and Weak Feelings, which depicts his grandson, Morty's, face. The icons consist of a few I sourced through the internet, while most I made myself in Photoshop. The color pallete comes directly from the profile image on the right-most side of the web page, but is more subdued to mimic the original composition challenge. Additionally, hover effects have been added to all of the square boxes and the buttons over the profile image to make the site a bit more immersive.

For the responsive layout, I moved the profile image to the top in a landscape layout and placed the other 'profile boxes' beneath it. Due to the arrangement of my original boxes, I had two yellow ones that blended into one another, so I re-ordered them to maintain a more cohesive color scheme. For the empty space at the bottom-right corner, I added a floating image of Rick so the void was more interesting when seen on the mobile layout.

Looking back on this project, I'm still proud of what I accomplished, but can appreciate that it needs a lot of work to look good and fully satisfy the requirements of the assignment. During this project, I was experimenting with various untis of measurement and had decided to give view height (vh) and view width (vw) a shot. At the time it seemed to fix the issues that I was having in flexbox, but only solved it for one screen size: mine. The responsive was passable, but didn't look good or function well across all types of screens. If I had an opportunity to clean this project up, I would change all of the units of measurements to something simpler (ie px, em, rem) and adjust the color palette so it wasn't as loud.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub URL](https://hartiganhm.github.io/hh-comp-challenge-2/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

My version of *Static Comp 2* is called localCO, a website where you can find local makers in Colorado and see what types of products they offer, as well as what local markets they're attending. All of the basic icons were sourced through free icon websites and the 'localCO' logo was found online and modified in Photoshop to fit within the asthetic scope of the web page. The accent color of the page is North Texas Green, which is the same color used for the Colorado Company badge, which is given to local business by the state of Colorado. Additional color compliments on the page are derived from this accent color to make for a more cohesive template.

The web page is built from a card based system, with each card representing a different vendor. As a small business owner myself, all of these businesses are owned by people I either know personally or have worked with in the past. Each card has an image representative of the company, their brand name, location, and what their product specialty is. Though the numbers are randomly assigned, additional values for number of upcoming markets and exclusive offers are also present.

Responive features of the web page maintain a four card row on larger displays, but maintain the overall aspect ratio of the card on smaller displays and mobile. The console in the header also restructures on smaller displays, making sure no buttons shrink or are illegible.

I think overall I did really well with this challenge. I did a much better job with managing my time and getting the assignment completed ahead of time. Additionally, I took Louisa's advise and decided to use pixel measurements instead of vh or vw. This helped so that scaling wasn't as chaotic on mobile as it was in my first static comp assignment. I also decided to change the color palette slightly, but not so much that it go out of hand. I was also able to do this and change the subject matter while maintaining the overall scope of the static comp. However, while I was able to make the webpage more responsive for mobile, I didn't take larger screens into consideration, which is something I kept note of for future projects.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

My version of the page kept a majority of the overall content and copy in the interest of matching the layout of the static comp as closely as possible. With that in mind, the colors and layout are essentially the same, with minor variences that were up to interpretation, such as hover states, active states, and icons. With the amount of information on the page, I thought it best to get the small layout intricacies working before radically changing the copy/content/color-scheme, a goal I think I accomplished and am very proud of.

With this in mind, however, I didn't solve some of the more complex CSS animations that I would have liked and had to resort to more static CSS designs or images. Additionally, while the project has fun elements in it (ie relating to my dog, Torin) I would like to revisit this project and make it my own, switching up the subject matter and adjusting the copy and color palette accordingly.

Overall, I am very pleased with what I accomplished. While all of the spacing and padding isn't necessarily perfect, I think it is increbily close to being so. With some minor adjustments, I think I could make it a seamless layout. I am also very proud of the responsive features of this website. Attacking each section of the static comp one at a time, I was able to focus on the individual aspects of that area and then marry it into what I had already created. While the responsive aspect of the webpage, again, isn't perfect, I think there are some very clean and intuitive solutions to the challenge we were presented with in making the static comp a responsive webpage.

**Evaluator: Louisa**

**Evaluation Comments**
- good work pushing through functionality
- design choices made to accommodate extensions in functionality were not user friendly making it unclear and difficult to understand how to use the app
- overall, solid effort! Code could use some clean up and tidying, which is what we expect for this first project.

>We have similar working styles of a kind of divide and conquer mentality with the occasional reconvene when either of us hit roadblocks. Our working hours complimented each others daily work cycle as well. These two things made working together have a natural synergy. At the onset I think we struggled to divide up work effectively, probably due to this being our first project. Once we started the daily morning meetings and got a kickstart from Franklin we started to hit our stride. He did a great job communicating what he was working on and what was next. He did an exceptional job on the css and was able to walk me through the more challenging javascript. And he really took to heart to commit often and make the commit messages clear. It's hard to find something actionable. Moving forward I would suggest more communication over the weekend or use of remote screen share. But besides that it was a great first project and I look forward to working with Hugh again in the future.
