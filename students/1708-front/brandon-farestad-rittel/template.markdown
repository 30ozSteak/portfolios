# Brandon Farestad-Rittel - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In this module I hoped to get a much deeper understanding of what I knew about HTML and CSS, as well as get a soild grasp of the fundamentals of JavaScript. I worked toward this by making sure all projects were completed to the best of my ability, and using the resources available outside of class time to improve. Additionally, I hoped to start building relationships within the Turing community to become a full contributing member.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

These were projects I worked on individually outside of class time. Number Guesser is the first JS project, while the static comps are all focused on HTML and CSS.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was the first JavaScript project. It required an input and submit that would register a guess of a random number between 1-100 and tell you if it was too low or too high. When the number was guessed, it would return BOOM!

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/bfr-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This was the first static comp, which required us to recreate the layout of a website using HTML and CSS. It was also the first time using Flex Box and responsive design. My project focused on Hank Hill, Assistant Manager Strickland Propane.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfarestadrittel/bfr-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project expanded on the usage of HTML and CSS, requiring us to build a more complicated layout. It had a card-style layout with different features within each card. It was more responsive than the previous project, and focused on a site where users could create a custom baseball team with player cards.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These were all JavaScript and jQuery projects completed in a paired project. I really enjoyed the paired projects as an opportunity to learn from different perspectives and work through things with others in the cohort.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In Mod1 it's tricky to get your feet under you and still feel like you're making a significant contribution to the larger community. However, I tried to focus on the areas where I could contribute. I tried to keep in mind the duties of keeping the kitchen clean. Putting away dishes, emptying the full water trays and generally tidying up. I also tried to attend any other Turing events outside of the normal hours including guest speakers, happy hours, etc. Considering the amount of help I received, I always made sure to stick around and help others when they asked or jump in to offer assistance when possible.
