## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

In Mod1 it's tricky to get your feet under you and still feel like you're making a significant contribution to the larger community. However, I tried to focus on the areas where I could contribute. I tried to keep in mind the duties of keeping the kitchen clean. Putting away dishes, emptying the full water trays and generally tidying up. I also tried to attend any other Turing events outside of the normal hours including guest speakers, happy hours, etc. Considering the amount of help I received, I always made sure to stick around and help others when they asked or jump in to offer assistance when possible.
