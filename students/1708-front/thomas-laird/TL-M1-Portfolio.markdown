# Thomas Laird - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This mod my primary emphasis was upon building upon my limited skillset in javscript in order to effectively complete the projects defined in this mod while simultaneously acquiring the building blocks to be effective in CSS and HTML as well.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I fulfilled the requirements to move on from Module 1.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects for Mod 1 were Number Guesser at the start of the mod followed by the three static compositions. I believe that these projects provided an opportunity for personal growth over the course of the module and also to take full ownership of both the deficiencies and successes of any given project.
