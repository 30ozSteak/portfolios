# Katie Scruggs - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My focus this module was to learn best practices for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I could carry those basics with me through the rest of my learning as I add more complicated frameworks and skills. I also wanted to learn how to program with others in a collaborative setting. I feel like I have learned solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, and I have also learned a lot about how to work on a project with a partner.
