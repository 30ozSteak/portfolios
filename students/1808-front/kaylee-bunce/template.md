# Kaylee Bunce -  Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Coming into Turing, I first and foremost wanted to make it through mod 1 successfully. Successfully means several things including: soaking up and retaining as much information as possible, keeping myself physically and mentally recharged, and developing and implementing skills that will help throughout my time here at Turing and when I enter the workforce. I sought out to implement certain study habits on the weekends that helped me review the past week's lectures as well as pre-reading next week's lectures. I knew that time management and delegation was going to be important as I am know to jump around and get distracted very easily.

## C: Group Work & Projects

(Intro)

### Linked List

#### GitHub Repo
  - https://github.com/kayleenovak/Linked-List
#### Original Assignment
  - http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

#### Overview
  - Build an application that takes two inputs, a website name and the website's URL, to create a bookmark which should be prepended to the page. Each bookmark should have a delete and marked as read button. The delete button should delete the associated bookmark, and the mark as read button should be marked as read when the associated button is clicked. The application should have a function that omits an incorrect URL. The application should have a "Clear Read Bookmarks" button which will change the read bookmarks back to unread bookmarks. 

#### Evaluation Comments
  - Need many more small commits and branches for each feature
  - Great work on the comp and matching the design
  - Good use of semantic tags and aria labels to describe inputs and buttons
  - Nice work CSS, a few situations where we could group some similar styles together
  - Nice organization of of global variables, event listeners, and function declarations
  - Remember to clear out console.logs before evals
  - Instead of using alerts, try implementing the errors in the DOM
  - Good work breaking functions out into smaller functions
  - A few situations where you might be able to take away some of the global variables (the counters)
  - One or two situations where we don't need the extra else if statement, an else statement would work fine
