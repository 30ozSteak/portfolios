# Ashley Levi - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into module 1 I had no prior experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, therefore, my goal was to learn as much as possible and to build a strong foundation in all three of these areas. In addition to building these technical foundations and working on my technical vocabulary, I wanted to improve upon my soft skills. These included: learning how to work and communicate with different groups of people, public speaking, and time management. Upon completing module 1, I feel that I am now competent in all of these areas.

#### Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

For this project I created a number guessing game where the user is challanged to correctly guess a randomly generated number.  The user can instantiate their own minimum and maximum number-range and then the application will generate a random number between those minimum and maximum inputs. If the user guesses correcly, the game will tell them 'BOOM!', and then the minimum range decreases by 10 and the maximum range increases by 10.
