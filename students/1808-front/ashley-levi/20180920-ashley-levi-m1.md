# Ashley Levi - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into module 1 I had no prior experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, therefore, my goal was to learn as much as possible and to build a strong foundation in all three of these areas. In addition to building these technical foundations and working on my technical vocabulary, I wanted to improve upon my soft skills. These included: learning how to work and communicate with different groups of people, public speaking, and time management. Upon completing module 1, I feel that I am now competent in all of these areas.

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

For this project I created a number guessing game where the user is challanged to correctly guess a randomly generated number.  The user can instantiate their own minimum and maximum number-range and then the application will generate a random number between those minimum and maximum inputs. If the user guesses correcly, the game will tell them 'BOOM!', and then the minimum range decreases by 10 and the maximum range increases by 10.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ashleylevi/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)
* Evaluation: Great at replicating the original comp. Need to work on having better control of media queries with more complicated layouts. 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked List

For this project we created a bookmarking application where you can create bookmarks for all of your favorite websites. You can mark any bookmark as read and/or delete a bookmark. The application will keep a counting track of all bookmarks created and all bookmarks that are marked as read.

Hey Ashley, here's your feedback from Theo on Linked List:
Ashley was very organized overall and drove the progress by being on-time and having a "can-do" attitude. We did a great job of spacing out work time and getting our work done early. For coaching, keep up the strong communication!

#### Idea Box

For this project we created a bookmarking application where you can create bookmarks for all of your favorite websites. You can mark any bookmark as read and/or delete a bookmark. The application will keep a counting track of all bookmarks created and all bookmarks that are marked as read.

* [Evaluation Comments](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1808/mod-1/idea-box/cole-ashley.md)
* Feedback from Cole:
Ashley and I worked very well together on IdeaBox. I appreciated how she had a flexible working schedule, and was willing to meet whenever I could meet. We both had similar mindsets that we wanted to get a majority of the project done over the weekend so we would have a good start on it going into the week. Ashley is very organized and determined worker, and I appreciate that we both learned a lot during this project. I really appreciated that we alternated driving and navigating because it helped me to really understand what we were doing. One thing that we can both do to improve next time is to make sure we make our website responsive even if the directions dont say to.

#### 2Do Box

For this project we created a bookmarking application where you can create bookmarks for all of your favorite websites. You can mark any bookmark as read and/or delete a bookmark. The application will keep a counting track of all bookmarks created and all bookmarks that are marked as read.
