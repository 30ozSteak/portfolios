# Ashley Levi - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming into module 1 I had no prior experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, therefore, my goal was to learn as much as possible and to build a strong foundation in all three of these areas. In addition to building these technical foundations and working on my technical vocabulary, I wanted to improve upon my soft skills. These included: learning how to work and communicate with different groups of people, public speaking, and time management. Upon completing module 1, I feel that I am now competent in all of these areas.

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

For this project I created a number guessing game where the user is challanged to correctly guess a randomly generated number.  The user can instantiate their own minimum and maximum number-range and then the application will generate a random number between those minimum and maximum inputs. If the user guesses correcly, the game will tell them 'BOOM!', and then the minimum range decreases by 10 and the maximum range increases by 10.

#### Static Comp 1
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ashleylevi/al-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)
* Evaluation: Great color scheme. Need to work on understanding how media queries work and implementing them effectively. Need to work on fine tuning the details. 

#### Static Comp 2
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ashleylevi/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)
* Evaluation: Much better control of media queries on this project. Need to work on understanding and implementing best practices for design, such as optimal color contrast principals. 

#### Static Comp 3
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ashleylevi/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)
* Evaluation: Great at replicating the original comp. Need to work on having better control of media queries with more complicated layouts.
