# Jamie Rushford - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to build a very strong base of knowledge and skills to support me as I move beyond Mod 1 into more complex topics. I knew coming into the program that logic and JavaScript would be something I would have to work a little harder at than design/CSS work, so I tried to spend a good amount of time focusing on dialing those skills. I also looked to start finding my own professional place in software development/the things I gravitate towards, as well as my place in the Turing community, which I look to continue doing throughout my time here. In terms of technical skills going forward I want to continue practicing JS and logic so that I feel more comfortable with it as things start to get more complex. I also want to just continue playing with CSS and design to keep up those skills and continue to polish and expand what I feel comfortable doing on that wide of things.
