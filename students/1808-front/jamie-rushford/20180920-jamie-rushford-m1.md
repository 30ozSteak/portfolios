# Jamie Rushford - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to build a strong base of knowledge and skills to support me as I move beyond Mod 1 into more complex topics. I knew coming into the program that logic and JavaScript would be something I would have to work a little harder at than design/CSS work, so I tried to spend a good amount of time focusing on dialing those skills. I also looked to start finding my own professional place in software development/the things I gravitate towards, as well as my place in the Turing community, which I look to continue doing, and perhaps doing more so, throughout my time here. In terms of technical skills going forward I want to continue practicing JS and logic so that I feel more comfortable with it as things start to get more complex. I also want to just continue playing with CSS and design to keep up those skills and continue to polish and expand what I feel comfortable doing on that side of things.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project involved making a game where a user gusses a number between 1 and 100 and is given feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The range can also be change to increase or decrease difficulty.

- Like the bouncing animation for winning!
- Be sure to add directions for the user about the range changing - the numbers positined on the side are not intuitive
- Nice job using forms around inputs
- Good organization in CSS - look into [clustering related properties](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) for a different approach to organization
- Watch formatting in your JS files - follow the style guide [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
- Work on naming in JS 
- Nice job with breaking functionality apart

- Functional Expectations: Exceptional
- Comp Recreation/Design: Advanced Beginner/Proficient
- HTML: Proficient
- CSS: Proficient
- JS/jQuery: Advanced Beginner/Proficient
- Surprise and Delight: Sparkles

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/jr-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project involved recreating a static site based on a provided comp. Creative liberty was given with the copy, images, and icons, provided they made sense. Creative liberty was not given with the layout, which must be also be responsive.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/jr-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project involved recreating a static site based on a provided comp. Creative liberty was given with the copy, images, and icons, provided they made sense. Creative liberty was not given with the layout, which must be also be responsive. Additionally, a CSS Normalize file must be used and the site must be compatible with Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari.

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jarushford/jr-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This project involved recreating a static site based on a provided comp. Creative liberty was given with the copy, images, and icons, provided they made sense. Creative liberty was not given with the layout, which must be also be responsive. Additionally, a CSS Normalize file must be used, the site must be compatible with Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari, and the circle graphs must be made using SVGs.
