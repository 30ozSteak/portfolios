## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

* I set out to accomplish learning the basics of Rails and building dynamic web applications.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

* I struggled most in the first two weeks of the Mod, since everything was so drastically different than the first Mod. This was not unexpected, as Mod 1 was similar until I was able to get a grasp on the basic concepts and build my more advanced knowledge from there. I've learned that I quite capable of learning these technologies and to try to not let it affect me when I am struggling. All it takes is one aha! moment to get it down. I also struggled during the Ruby challenge, which made me realize I need to continue to go back and do ruby challenges to keep that fresh in my mind.
