## Areas of Emphasis
<br>

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
<br>

I set out to build cool things, I am happy with what I helped to create.
<br>

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
<br>

  I didn't really understand many-to-many/joins tables for a while. I struggled in timed assessments, I think I was hindered because I thought I grasped it, but I really didn't.
  I learned that I really need to focus on timed assessments and technical interview questions
  because given time I can make cool things, but in a high pressure environment I tend to breakdown.

## Projects
<br>

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
<br>

I liked Bike Share a lot, my team was a blast. I liked Ideabox because it was a good place to see
what I can do on my own. My least favorite may have been Job Tracker, but I still liked it.
<br>

What did you learn from your independent projects?
<br>


I really enjoyed seeing what I could do on my own. I got to do admin and logins, which was really interesting, also I learned how to hit 3 different apis which I enjoyed.
<br>

What did you learn from your paired projects?
<br>

I learned that I really excel at in-person collaboration. With bike share we spent a lot of time together throwing ideas around, and having fun. With Little Shop we had a lot of separate work time and I struggled by myself. In an ideal world I'd love to work remote, and I know in the industry working remote is really common. So I want to to learn how to work on team projects remotely. Working with Max was awesome for a lot of reasons, he's patient and a good teacher. I noticed myself hyper analyzing my code because I didn't want to disappoint him, which is funny.
<br>

## Community
<br>


What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
<br>

 The attention economy. It was really pertinent and spoke to me. The mod4 gear up was a bit boring I think. I didn't get too much out of it.
<br>


How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
<br>

I participated in Pahlka and at most social things
<br>

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

More group meditation/health things.
