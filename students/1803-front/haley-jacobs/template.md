# (Haley Jacobs) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod emphasized HTML, CSS (flex-box and grid were included), and JavaScript foundations. We learned the basics of GitHub, different approaches to partner pairing, sublime, mark down formatting, and so much more. We learned to build websites, make them responsive, and the significant role of aria in coding. We touched on the basics of JavaScript and dipped into JQuery. Mostly focusing on array prototypes, objects, constructor functions, and the foundations of coding (variables, functions, testing etc) that is necessary to build a solid understanding of programming.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual projects were a good way to tell where I was personally in my coding skills. It was challenging to not be able to rely on someone else at all, but it was a good way to motivate me to reach out to people in upper mods for help. The static comp series was a challenge, especially the third comp challenge. We had all the skills to do the project thoroughly, the biggest challenge for me was time blocking and pacing myself with the workload. Although flex-box and grid were not necessary to complete these projects, they were very helpful to those who were fluent in them. They are worth the effort. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/Number_Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project was our first introduction to JavaScript. We were asked to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100. When the guess was too high, the game returned that it was too high. For a guess that was too low, it returned that it was too low. If the player guessed the right answer it told them.

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/hj-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

This project was designed to help us work with our HTML and CSS skills. You had to follow the same layout as the template, but we could choose the topic we wanted to create our project on. 

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/hj-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

The second Static Comp challenge was very similar to the first, the only difference was in the layout of the page. It was more complex in some ways; more CSS styling was involved, we had more chances to use CSS effects, and also more complex HTML code.

#### Static Comp 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/hj-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

The final Static Comp challenge was very difficult for most people. As I stated above, flex-box and grid were not necessary to complete these projects, but they were very helpful to those who knew how to use them. It was a complicated template with many different sections designed to challenge Mod 1 students and used as part of the 'pentathalon'.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects were a great opportunity to grow relationships with other members in the cohort and tune our pairing skills. Learning how to navigate GitHub with a partner (merging, pull requests, branches) is a good (and sometimes very frustrating) way to learn how to pair with people remotely in the future. It also helps to have someone to talk about the project with who is as invested in it as you are. Personally, I am not a partner person and have always preferred to work independently. To my surprise I really enjoyed the partner pairings and think it has been great to learn the most effective ways to pair and learn from others. 

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In this project we were asked to create a list of cards given the user input. There were rules about the cards being able to be created, such as the URL input had to be an actual valid URL or the program would display an error message. The cards had to have certain features such as a delete button and a read button.

*Feedback to me:* You were a really great partner and I think our project went very well! I know its hard learning all of this in such a short period of time. I felt that you were honestly doing your best to contribute to the project and learn as much as you could as well. It seems like you really have a inclination toward coding, and if you keep working at it, you'll get it! I thought we worked well together, you were very available to work together and also were good at working with me remotely. As for things to work on, really the only thing I can think of is just being more confident in yourself in the evals(yeah, its nerve wracking!). I would say that practicing explaining your code line by line beforehand has been helpful for me. In conclusion, I enjoyed working with you and wish you the best in the future!

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hljacobs5/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project was similar to Linked List with some key differences. Again, we were supposed to create a thing (idea) and add it to a list. This was the first time we used objects and constructor functions in a project. The idea had features on it such as delete and a quality rating.  

[Evaluation comments & scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-1/idea-box/haley-todd.md)

*Feedback to me:* Haley was a genuinely hard worker and was able to fill in a lot of gaps  that I had in my knowledge. She had a lot of familial resources that were also very helpful. She was down to meet up pretty much any time and was very flexible. It was fun to find little wins together and get things working. It was mostly nice to just have her to bounce off of and explain anything I wasn't quite understanding. I really don't have much as far as coaching feedback because I felt our styles really complimented each other. 

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kyleewellons/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

The final partner project of the mod, and the most challenging. We were given a code base (repository) for IdeaBox that belonged to another group in our Mod and asked to refactor it. All the functionality on IdeaBox was required and then new functionality was to be added onto it. It was a lot more challenging working with other peoples code than it sounded, but a good way to get exposure to what programmers are doing a lot of the time since you will often work with other peoples code. 

[Evaluation comments & scores](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-1/2dobox/kylee-haley.md)

*Feedback to me:* Thank you so much for the time and energy that you put into this project. Working on 2DoBox was not easy for either of us and I am impressed by your willingness to keep pushing forward. I enjoyed the time we spent gathering information and help from our peers as well as learning from you. As far as coaching feedback, I would say organizing your time and sticking to a task list would make you undoubtedly an unstoppable programmer. Our scheduling started off well; and I understand toward the last few days of our project, the deadline got closer and both our workloads stacked up. To combat any scheduling conflicts, I arranged my schedule specifically to work on our project together and tried to confirm those times with you unsuccessfully.  When we did meet there was a lot of switching between tasks on our list, and following one functionality at a time until it's complete is the best option. I have come to find that completing the project isn't as important as what you learn from every aspect of it, and I learned a lot from working with you. Thank you

## D: Professional Skills
Throughout the Mod we had Professional Development where we met up with BE Mod1 and gained insight into understanding ourselves and the way we relate to others in the workplace and in life. During these sessions, we were often given a set of questions and asked to pair with each other and talk the questions through. It was a good way to meet people in the BE program and further our relationships with people in our own module. 

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

This session was a reminder to the Turing students that self care is vital even when times are stressed. It emphasized the importance of exercise, eating healthy, and keeping up with hobbies even while at Turing because they are vital in self care. In return, self care is vital to success at Turing and in life. 

#### Code Debugging The Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

In this Gear Up session we discussed how gender means much more than what our physical bodies look like. It's important to remember that everyone deserves to be heard and that their opinions are valid and important just like we value our own. Never forget that programming (and anything) is inclusive to everyone who wants to participate, it is not biased in any way. 

#### Choice Session, Mod 4 facilitated

* "The Value of Introverts" - Mod 4 facilitated

I attended "The Value of Introverts" session. I often gravitate towards those kinds of sessions because I know I will be able to relate to others in them. It was fun to hear about other people's views about being introverted, and how they dealt with the world being so busy and full of stimulation. It's easy to feel out of place when it seems everyone else enjoys going out and being social even though you find other things more fun. I was again reminded I am not the only one who often prefers solitude and there is nothing wrong with that. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I have cleaned all the dishes in the sink before even when they weren't mine.
