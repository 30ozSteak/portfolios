# 20180418-kent-huntsman-m1 - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I had no experience with Html, Css or javascript before starting this program.  My coding experience prior to Turing was in older logic based programing languages that are no longer used today.  I wanted to gain more knowledge and hands on experiece in modern programing to help prepare me for a new career.  By implementing the advise from my instructors I learned how to learn the information in a more effective and effficient manner.  My understanding of javascript grew greatly by implementing such advise.  My confidence in html, css and javascript grew greatly over these last 6 weeks.  I hope to further this confidence in my coding ability in the preceding mods.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)


## B: Individual Work & Projects
Our individual projects this mod were the number guesser and three static comps that put heavy emphasise on html and css.  I really enjoy the logic aspect of the projects that employ it.  The design aspect is not my strong point but I am putting forth the effort to learn and get better at it. 


#### number Guesser

* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Build a game where you guess a random number between 1 and 100. This was a nice challange for someone new to javascript. I refactored it while traviling for work.  That was very enjoyable.

Static Comp Challenge 1
Recreate a static web page.  It is designed to keep your html and css strong.

https://github.com/KHunts4130/KH-comp-challenge-1
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html
This first static comp really hit home that my html and css where lacking.  I took the feedback and implemted it that night. Started to spend more time learning Aria.

Static Comp Challenge 2
Recreate another static web page. this time a little harder.  Designed to improve your html and css skills.

https://github.com/KHunts4130/KH-comp-challenge-2
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html
I felt much better with my html and css skills for static comp 2.  Still need to improve my Aria skills and responsiveness.

Static comp challange 3
https://github.com/KHunts4130/KH-comp-challenge-3.1
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html
This was a much more difficult static comp.  The compexity was a little daunting at first but as I worked into the code it all began to click.  Still working on Aria and my responsiveness is getting much better.


## C: Group Work & Projects
I really enojoyed idea box as I had an epiphany on javascript / jquery and everything about the logic being turned into code really clicked for me on that program.

### Projects
Linked List

#### (linked list)

* [https://github.com/KHunts4130/linked-list]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html]()

Build a simple app to allow the user to build a list of bookmarked site with links. Can be marked as read and deleted.

(https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-1/linked-list/kent-dave.md)

(Kent was always committed to the end goal, easy to get in touch with, and hard-working. Even when things don't yet make sense, he's willing to play around and figure it out before it's covered in class. One area of coaching would be to map out or plan what things to tackle first. To do this, you could try out a different workflow. )

#### (Idea Box)
(https://github.com/KHunts4130/idea-box)
(http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
Build an app for saving and recording ideas. The app is to have real time filtering of stored data.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication to this project. I enjoyed the learning opportunity to teach each other and ask questions. I want to make sure that you get the practice that you want. Maybe you could continue to re-type the functions, without looking to get that keyboard time, muscle memory, and function recognition. Thank you again for the time and dedication, I look forward to working with you in the future.
#### (ToDoBox Pivot)
(https://github.com/KHunts4130/ToDoBox-Pivot)
(http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)
Refactor a code base in jquery and add new features and fix non working features in existing code base.
(https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-1/2dobox/joel-kent.md)

It was great working with Kent. I know we had a hard code repository that we inherited and it lead us through many adventures to get things working through the many quirks. You're a hard worker and it was definitely great that you were upfront about what you thought. I also appreciated that you were good at collaborating on work. I think we both could have been better at committing more time to the project but given the current time crunch I think we took advantage of what time we had.

## D: Professional Skills
In mod one you learn skills about how to learn, learn your strengths and weaknesses and how to adapt to these traits so you can be a successful developer.

### Gear Up
#### (Health and Wellness)

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md]()
The session focused on different kinds of stressors and ways to help combat the stress.  The talk about chronic emotional stress hit home for me as I live with an individual with serious health issues.  There where a few methods that I had not been utalizing in my life to help deal with this stressor.  Trying not to take things so personally is hard for me with this individual but it is something that I must do to keep myself centered and primed for success.
 ### (Debugging the gender gap)
 
 [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md]
 The gender gap is real, that's a same.  One real takeaway from this talk was that in the 1980's the industry had almost hit parity in employement but now all these years later has become even more male dominated.  It is important to accept everyones story as truth as it is their truth, taken from their experiences. The irony of all this is that the first computer language was designed by a female but their contrabution to the industry is not talked about.  The biggest take away is that everyone no matter what gender or identification should have the same oppertunities as skill and intelligence is not attached to the x or y chromosome.
 
 ### (Your_Sartphone_is_a_Civil_Rights_Issue)
 [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1803-inning/Your_Sartphone_is_a_Civil_Rights_Issue.md]
 I choose this topic as privacy is an important topic for me.  I am a very private person and understand the importance of privacy in your everyday life.  Without privacy or implied privacy one can not be themselves as they are always wondering if they are being watched.  This type of thing encourages conformity and negative connotations to those who want privacy in their lives.  This is what a government needs to help control the populace.  The constant threat of surveillance keeps the populace compliant and pliable to the governments wishes and their wishes aren't for you to have a wonderful fulfilling life. It's for you to not cause trouble / dissent.

## E: Community Participation
  
### Playing a Part

I started the mod trying to learn by myself as I have in the past but you can not succeed at Turing without the community.  I found my classmates a wealth of knowledge and leaned on them throughout the 6 weeks.  I helped anyone I felt I had the knowledge to help.  We also went out after class for some social / blow off steam time together.
