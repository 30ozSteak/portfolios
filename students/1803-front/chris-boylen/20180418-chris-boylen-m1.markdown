## Areas of Emphasis

My goal during this module was to learn to develop a solid foundation in the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. I also wanted to be able to effectively work with my classmates during group projects.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work and projects were an opportunity to apply the concepts that we learned in class, and use a little creative freedom while doing so.  I enjoyed the continual learning process and the opportunity to apply what I learned to these projects.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were 3 paired programming assignments with one other person. Every project built upon the knowledge you received in the previous one and added new challenges and features.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JesseMcBrennan/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

The main focus of this project is on DOM manipulation, creating elements dynamically.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chrisboylen/ideaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

The main focus of this project was to create an app that could save ideas and vote on quality. This was accomplished by utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript and implementing localStorage and using JSON.

#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brianw11/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

The focus of this project was to be able to work in a codebase that is not your own, refactoring, and implementing new features to this codebase. We inherited another group's IdeaBox project and had to refactor, and implementing new features.

## D: Professional Skills
Turing’s mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.

Turing’s Gear up sessions focus on unlocking students’ potential in cultivating self-awareness and empathy. These Gear up sessions included, Health and Wellness, Debugging the gender gap, and Mindfulness.

### Gear Up
#### Health and Wellness
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/47b936ce64782229a4338512818b5388e0e70f8d/Growth_Mindset_Facilitator_Guide.markdown)

In this Gear up we Learn what a "growth mindset" is and how it will help us succeed at Turing and in the tech industry. I learned that people who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. Never say, I can't.

### Gear Up
#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/95a12de8a302ee4d56b3537016c1b0ab92ab8f01/archive/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

In this Gear up we talked about the large gap between men and women in technology. Technology is one of the key drivers of social and economic change, and that's one of the reason that i'm going to Turing.  We need to be aware and bridge the gender gap because people who are unlike me, make me see the world in new and interesting ways helping to create more and interesting ideas/soutions.

### Gear Up
#### Mindfulness

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/e215ab94993b2a1087ead93e0e4425690c6bd010/m4_sessions/1803-inning/Mindfulness_In_Practice.md)

In this Gear up we talked about Mindfulness. Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.  I learned that we all have an inner voice in our head. It's important to recognize that voice and implement strategies to minimize that negative self-talk.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I participated in study sessions with my classmates to help each other overcome areas that were difficult, extend moral support to each other, and help keep each other accountable to our goals.  I helped clean up dishes and trash, and overall tried to help foster an inclusive environment inside and outside of Turing.
