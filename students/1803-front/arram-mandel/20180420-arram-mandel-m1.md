## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I set out to gain a solid foundational understanding of javascript and jquery. I also set out to improve my html and css knowledge to the point that I could design realistic looking websites. I also set out to gain the vocabulary necessary to articulate my code and any problems that could come up.

I believe I passed the end of module assessment overall


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Besides the static compositions, my only individual project was the number guesser. I believe it went well for a first project. There were clear opportunites for growth and I came away knowing what I needed to improve upon for the next project.
