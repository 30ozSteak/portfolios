# (Arram Mandel) -M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I set out to gain a solid foundational understanding of javascript and jquery. I also set out to improve my html and css knowledge to the point that I could design realistic looking websites. I also set out to gain the vocabulary necessary to articulate my code and any problems that could come up.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I passed the end of module assessment overall


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Besides the static compositions, my only individual project was the number guesser. I believe it went well for a first project. There were clear opportunites for growth and I came away knowing what I needed to improve upon for the next project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Our group projects consisted of the linked-list, ideabox and todobox. These projects built on eachother and the ability to work well with your partner was part of the grade. We were also graded on javascript/jquery functionality as well as html and css layout.)

## D: Professional Skills

(These sessions were designed to help us maintain balance and avoid dangerous levels of stress while taking on this amount of work. They were also designed to address problems in the tech industry and approaches we can take to make them a little better.)

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health 101)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

(While I went into this program knowing that it was going to be the bulk of my life, I quickly learned that I had to maintain a chunk of time for other things. I learned that it was more important now to keep exercising and eating right. I must take constant steps)

#### (Debugging the Gender gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

(I learned that despite best efforts, there are barriers in the development industry that still need to be broken down. I learnted that we must be proactive in making sure everyone feels included in the work environment and that a great web developer can come from anywhere. I continue to think about my own biases I may or may not be acting upon on some level)
(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### (Your phone as a civil rights issue)

(There was no github resource for this session)

(This session was about the growing privacy issues faced through online companies selling your information. When you're not charged for the product, you are the product. I learned that the user agreements need to written in a more clear way so users know what they are agreeing to. After the session I also continue to think that if there's a desire to not have your private information shared, then maybe the problem could be mitigated if we made it profitable to not share data. Many companies would come on board if there was profit to be made.)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(I participated in all PD and Gearup sessions. I tried to learn something from each session and grow as a person. I helped my fellow students with their code whenever I could. And asked clarification questions in class for myself and others.)
