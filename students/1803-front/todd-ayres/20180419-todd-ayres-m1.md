# Todd Ayres - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal was to get a solid base knowledge in javascript/jQuery while honing some of the skills I previously possessed in HTML and CSS. I wanted to utilize all of the resources available to me - including mostly pairing with higher module students to push me forward even when I didn't feel ready or felt scared of my own limitations.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Number Guesser was an eye opener and in retrospect, I feel confident in recreating it without the struggle I felt at the time. Other than that, I made a lot of progress with the static comps from project to project. Each one improved upon the last - whether it be better ARIA labeling or understanding the need for multiple media queries. I ended up feeling quite confident and proud of my final static comp given that I was able to get a head start and spend the time to get it to a quality place.

#### Number Guesser

https://github.com/ToddAyres2008/Number-Guesser
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

I used vanilla Javascript to create my first number guessing game. Limited design, but was an intro to DOM manipulation

Advanced Beginner in all categories, but proficient in comp recreation and design

#### Static Comp 1

https://github.com/ToddAyres2008/Static-Comp-1

I feel this was a good learning experience. I was able to learn grid and utilize it. My design skills clearly need work here, but I feel I learned a lot of basics and got a grasp on previously foreign aspects of the web design practices.

#### Static Comp 2

https://github.com/ToddAyres2008/Static-Comp-2

I made leaps and bounds ahead from my previous project. I even enjoyed the media query aspect. One thing I learned was plugging into larger screens to make sure I'm on the right track for larger interfaces. I was able to expand upon my previous design and also enjoyed giving it a more personal flair. Very enjoyable project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These projects randomly paired me with fellow Mod1 classmates to work together in more advanced DOM manipulation techniques and slightly more involved design/comp recreation.

#### Linked List

https://github.com/kevinkrom787/Linked-list
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

I paired with Kevin Krom to create a Linked List which appended cards to the DOM and incorporated functionality that mimicked a comment section.

Need to work on tree-shaking and formatting

Advanced beginner in all areas, but proficient in pairing and collaboration

Feedback to me: In retrospect there was a lot of organizational things that could be refactored in Javascript. Because we divided and conquered, there was a mixture of markup languages in places. Also, just because the JS was daunting in this project, does not mean I should let the eloquency of the HTML and CSS stylequides slide.

#### Idea Box

https://github.com/hljacobs5/idea-box
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

I paired with Hayley Jacobs on Idea Box where the DOM manipulation basically expanded on the previous Linked List project. We worked well together. I realized that I had retained many of my functional knowledge from Linked List, which allowed us to focus more on the expanded components of the project. Again, we were able to get further than anticipated and I felt good about the partnership.

Did really well on DOM manipulation and Conditional Logic, but fell short on following style guides. Collaborated well.

Advanced beginner in most areas, proficient in DOM manipulation and conditional logic, novice (need work) on styling and following the style guides.

Feedback to me: Again, I need not to get so spooked by functionality that I let (what feels like) more basic functionality and formatting on HTML and CSS fade into the background. It is not something I should be falling short on and given a second opportunity, this would not be an afterthought.

#### 2-DO List

https://github.com/spenserleighton1/2DoBox-Pivot
http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html

Spenser Leighton and I paired to refactor and expound upon a classmate pairing's Linked List and modify it into a similar "2 Do Box" Basically, we were tasked with tightening functionality, making language clearer, retitling and nesting variables inside of functions for greater proficiency. Great pairing and got a lot of insight on aspects of the project - such as using arrays, passing info into 'temperate literals' etc.

CSS could have used a bit of work in formatting and work on combining similar functions for brevity.

Proficient in all areas! We also were exceptional in the pairing department.

Feedback to me: Everything given to us is possible and taking each aspect of a project one at a time is important. Get where you can in the best way you know how. Don't just halfway complete a bunch of different tasks. Learning to walk through code using conditional logic is key. Also, writing down the steps is important.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/README.md

StrengthsFinder Reflection:
I took the test and always tend to question these results. Though I find them anecdotally interesting, I tend to want to break free of that mold. For instance, I noticed people who were identified as extroverts wanted to run with it and felt a certain sense of pride. My strengths felt a tad more mundane. Though I do cling to my categorization of adaptable. I tend to go into situations and meld into the version of me that is most applicable.

Working Styles:
I always tend to want to work on my own, but I've really come out of my shell in that regard. I realize that at Turing, asking for help is absolutely imperative and I've really enjoyed all three of my partner projects in different ways. I feel they progressively improved from project to project and I took something from each one.

Learning to Pair:
The DTR portion of this session was, in retrospect, the most crucial. Though my first pairing and I got along really well, we kind of jumped the gun on how to approach the project. It ended up well, but if given the opportunity again, I would want the communication to be in tact prior to beginning the project.

Feedback I:
In this era of really quick snap judgments and lowest common denominator rebuttals, I think this was probably the most helpful of the sessions. There is a tendency to want to take blame at certain points and to be too gentle at others. Sometimes you just want to say -it's all your fault. Constructive criticism is truly undervalued.

Storytelling and Strengths:
I found it interesting how open certain people could be in this setting. I'm happy to share tidbits about myself with others, but would prefer to keep the darker moments to myself until genuine trust has been established. Some people were open books, while others were much more guarded. I enjoyed meeting new people from other mods. Some stories were much more relatable than I would have thought if I had paused at my snap judgments.

Developer Identity:
I don't LOVE social media, so I'm always very hesitant to put myself out there in that way. I do realize the necessity of it though. I think my biggest takeaway from this session was how Linked In can be used as a storytelling device instead of just a one stop shop for resumes. I look forward to developing it further.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This was actually a part where I surprised myself. There is a larger multitude of personality types at Turing than I would have anticipated and I feel I got to know some very genuinely nice, interesting and three dimensional people. Our mod was very supportive and I felt that we all really had each other's backs. I participated in many pairings and met people across all mods and was very vocal in my ultimate appreciation toward them.
