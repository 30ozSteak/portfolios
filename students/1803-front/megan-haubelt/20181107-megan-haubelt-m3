# Megan Haubelt - M3 Portfolio

## Goals
After repeating mod3, I wanted to build back my confidence, gain a better understanding of Redux, and get better at testing.  I
believe that I improved in all of these areas. I was definitely more relaxed as I went through this mod, which definitely gave 
me a better learning experience and allowed me to retain more information.  I feel that there were many little things I never 
had time to look into last mod and doing this mod over allowed me to explore concepts in greater detail. I feel that am confident
and have a solid foundation going into mod4.

## Individual Self Assessment
I think I came a long way from the beginning of the mod (especially since the beginning of the last mod3)and improved on many 
of the deficiencies I had coming into this mod.  I  still need to get better at testing but I feel that my hard work and 
persistence has helped me make major strides with my learning.   

## Final Assessment

Final assessment: Pass
