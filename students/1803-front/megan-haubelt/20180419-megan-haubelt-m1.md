# Megan Haubelt - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I came in without a tech background and wanted to establish a good foundation that would allow me to build a solid skillset so that I will be prepared for what is to come in the rest of the program.  I definitely struggled and continuously stayed outside of my comfort zone, but I am amazed at how much material I learned in such a short period of time.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We completed three group projects in Mod1. It was a great opportunity to get to know some of my classmates better and figure out how to do some complex problem solving with another person.  Each person brought their own strengths and I was able to take something positive away from each person I completed a project with this mod.  

#### Linked List

* <a href="https://github.com/Haub/Linked-List">GitHub URL</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html">Original Assignment</a>

Linked List was a paired project I worked on with Laura Miller. The site allows a user to input a title and URL and the it appears in a list on the right side of the page.  The user can delete or mark the individual card as "read."


Partial phase 3
Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

COMP RECREATION / DESIGN
What you have looks great, would have liked to see you get farther
Advanced Beginner

HTML
Use less br's, try to accomplish the same affect using css margin
Advanced Beginner

CSS
Find a strategy for organizing your selectors and your property names. Alphabetical is a good place to start. Idiomatic can be a little more involved.
Advanced Beginner

JS/jQuery
use the variables you create var bookMarkList = document.querySelector('#listed-bookmarks'); $('#listed-bookmarks').on('click', '.read-button', readButtonClicked); could be $(bookMarkList).on('click', '.read-button', readButtonClicked); Try not to mix JS & jQuery DOM interaction

Feedback from Laura:
I am so glad we were partnered together for LinkedList. I really appreciate that you were open to meeting at a coffee shop vs being in the basement during the duration of our project. I was also very impressed with how you dealt with a crashing laptop! You handled it like a champ! I don't think I could have remained as cool and collected as you did. Nail down that Git workflow and the sky is the limit. There is no stopping you! Thank you for being a great partner and for allowing me to throw stuff at the wall when needed with our code, and for teaching me some of your CSS wisdom.

#### IdeaBox

* <a href="https://github.com/Haub/ideabox">GitHub URL</a>
* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html">Original Assignment</a>

In this project, Arram Mandel and I built a simple application for recording and archiving ideas.  One of the focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. We used JavaScript and jQuery to implement filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist ideas between sessions.

Evaluator: Pamela Lovett

Notes/What To Work On:
Some bugs in features
Use object to adhere to data model on spec
Good recreation of the comp - little bit of tightening up to make it pixel perfect
Nice work with HTML and accessibility
Good general org of CSS file
Opportunities for refactoring in JS
Always be sure to DTR
Functional Expectations
Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.

HTML
Accessibility
Proficient 
Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

Style
Proficient 
Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

CSS
Structure of Code
Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Implementation
Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

JAVASCRIPT
Data Types
Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.

Conditional Logic
Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.

Functions & Scope
Advanced Beginner Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.

Proficient 
Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.

Arrays
Advanced Beginner 
Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

Objects & Prototypes
Novice Can declare an object literal and define/articulate properties vs. methods for an object. Can extract values of an object’s property, and assign new properties and/or reassign values of existing properties on an object.

DOM Manipulation
Proficient Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

Style
Advanced Beginner Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs.
Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

GIT & GITHUB
Git
Advanced Beginner Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description.
Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

Github
Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

DESIGN
Comp Recreation
Proficient Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

PAIRING
Collaboration
Novice Can communicate needs, expectations, scheduling constraints through a DTR, effectively creating a working plan with partner.
Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.

TERMINOLOGY
Technical Vocab
Advanced Beginner Can articulate what is going on in the overall codebase and uses the correct terminology some of the time.
Proficient Can articulate what is going on in the codebase, line by line, using the correct terminology most of the time. Developer can speak to and answer questions that utilize technical vocabulary.

Feeback from Arram:
Megan was very easy to work with. She was cool tempered and willing to share the workload. She was responsive to suggestions and ideas. I appreciated her nicely done template literal setup for creating the ideaboxes. My only constructive coaching would be that I think future partner's would benefit from her being more prompt in responding to messages.

#### 2DoBox

* <a href="http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html">GitHub URL</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/Alexbruce1/2DoBox-Pivot">Original Assignment</a>

In this project, Alex Bruce and I were given someone else's code from IdeaBox.  We had to refactor and clean up the code we inherited. We also added additional functionality including a search filter and allowing the user to add, edit or delete a todo task.  These also had to be updated in Local Storage.

Evaluator: Nathaniel

Notes/What To Work On:
Completed does not save / hide on reload
No filters
Make sure you are referencing a local copy of jquery as a backup
Control width of parent when possible versus every child
Create seperate functions for storing and retrieving information from localStorage
Make sure to review how indexOf works

Feedback from Alex Bruce: 
I think you did really well with this project! You were really easy to work with, great about communication, good about making time to work on the project together, and really quick to set up those pairing sessions, which I think was awesome. I really appreciate the hard work, and especially appreciated the help and patience you gave me to understand some of the material I wasn't comfortable with yet. Overall, great job!


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Mental Health 101

During this session, we learned about stress and how to manage stress.  Self-care was a big part of the discussion. I feel that I handled stress well through the first few weeks and then I did a really poor job.  I battled having some sort of balance with home life, getting the flu, and enough exercise at the end of the module.  I am going to use this week break to relax, get out in nature, and spend some quality time with my family so I come back feeling refreshed.  This is going to be a huge focus of mine the next 6 weeks.

#### Working Styles

During this session, we talked about being an introvert and an extrovert and where we individually fall on the paradigm.  I believe I am right in the middle.  We also discussed how to work with individuals that fall on the opposite side than us.  I feel like I am pretty adaptable and like both individual work and group projects.  Software development seems to provide a perfect balance between the two.

#### Code Debugging The Gender Gap

I really appreciated this session and we watched a video about how prevalent the gender gap is in this industry.  We had a good small group discussion about how this plays out at Turing as well.  I feel that Turing makes a conscious effort to promote diversity and welcome individuals from underrepresented groups.  But it is still dominated by white males so the industry has a long way to go.   

#### Choice Session

I went to that talk about Public Data that was presented by 4 students in Mod4.  We had a great discussion about how to find public data to use for noble causes and it seems that there is so much data out there for free on government websites.  This really got me thinking about how I can combine my passions for data and refugees and do something positive with it.  I am going to continue to think about what I can do specifically.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

The Turing community is a special place and I was surprised to see how many resources we have available to us between our instructors, mod2, classmates, and a mentor.  I felt I always had support when I needed it and I appreciate all of the people that helped me these past 6 weeks.  I definitely took in more than I gave, but I hope to change that in upcoming mods. I tried to help my peers in class whenever I could. I did little things like fill coffee and clean dishes in the sink that weren't mine. I bought coffee for mod2 this week as a thank you.
