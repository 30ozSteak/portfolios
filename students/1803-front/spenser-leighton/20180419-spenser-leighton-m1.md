# Spenser Leighton - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to gain a basic knowledge of html, css, and javaScript. I wanted to be able to create websites that were both pleasing to the eye, and easy to use all while having the functionality that one would expect from the given site. My goals as a student were to work as hard as I can each day and to learn as much as possible from both the instructors and my classmates. I was very much focussed on my process, not only the outcome.

Feedback to me:
I thought you did great on the project. Honestly, the only thing I would say you could work on (and I think this is as much on me as it is on you), was the communication. Towards the end of the week, I wasn't really sure where you were with the project, and it felt strange that you had turned it in without me even knowing. Also, I think you completed a lot of the project without mentioning much to me. I feel like that could cause both partners to work on the same thing. But like I said, I think that was at least as much on me as is was on you. Overall I thought you did great! You took a ton of initiative in working on things and getting started.

Feedback to me: 
Thank you for your commitment and dedication in working on our first project together.  I appreciate your willingness to arrange our schedules to make time to work together.  I also appreciate your consistent positive attitude while working on a challenging project together.  This added value to our collaboration process during times where we hit an obstacle.  An opportunity for you to improve your development skills includes, understanding event propagation a little better.  I enjoyed working with you, and look forward to do so again in the future.

Feedback to me:
Spenser was a great partner. Probably my most compatible partner of the entire first mod. We both had a desire to push forward and asked for help when needed. I could see concepts gelling in his head. We worked on most of the project in tandem with little to no hiccups beyond the usual struggle to get things done that we have yet to be exposed to. It was a supportive and symbiotic partnership. I really have no coaching feedback beyond knowing when to ask for help if there is something we just can't wrap our head around. But he was always willing to find time to work together and never bailed on any time we had set aside for working. A+


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

In this session we talked a lot about stress and how to cope with it. One of the main things I took away from this session was that everyone is stressed, and being open about it is the easiest way to begin coping with it. I also liked the push to take care of yourself, It's very easy to forget little things like that when you're in a stressful environment (Turing).

#### Code Debugging The Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

In this section we discussed the gender gap in the tech industry and how to promote a more inclusive experience here at Turing. The main take aways for me were to remember to be mindful of my classmates backgrounds and identities. Everyone here comes from a different place and we should respect them all the same. We're all in this together. Also RAISE BOYS AND GIRLS THE SAME.

#### Fake News (lead by mod4)

* [GitHub URL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWb1DuWCsf0)

This gear up was lead by Mod4 and was focused on identifying fake news and it's pros and cons. The main takeaways from this gear up were to check the source of the news, understand news bias, and help stop the spread of fake news. I don't use social media that often so it was kind of eye opening to me. I don't think i realized fake news was such a big issue.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
At the start of Mod1 I wasn't adding much to the community. I was very much focussed on personal growth and trying not to fall behind. I helped classmates when I was able to, participated in school activities, and attended out off campus study groups as often as I could. I look forward to helping out the folks in Mod1 in a weeks or so.
