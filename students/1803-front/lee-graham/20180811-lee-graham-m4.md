# Module 4 Portfolio Presentation

## Learning Goals

* Gain comfort speaking about and defending their work and code using correct technical vocabulary
* Practice speaking in front of a group
* Build the skill of storytelling by presenting a compelling story about themselves and their work

## Requirements

* Students will prepare a markdown document and submit a pull request to the Turing Portfolios Repository using the template provided (more detail below under ***Submittal***).
* Students will also prepare a 10-12 minute slide presentation to give to a panel of 3-4 reviewers.

#### Both markdown document and slide presentation are to tell the same story, and should address the following questions:

The projects presented to us this mod were to create a connection between our back and front end development. It was a very solidifying year in grasping the concepts of how the information we send and receive is organized and stored.  We also got VERY in depth information of how to proceed into the job hunt and, subsequently, the professional world.
[30 DAY POST-GRAD ACTION PLAN](https://gist.github.com/TwirlingGoddess/630a4e5c22fee24555e7b2ddd7f5367f)

* What was your biggest achievement of the module? Building a Backend
* What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle? Getting to a place in the program where I thought I should know everything and being ok with the fact that I still needed to reach out for help on topics.
* What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers? Started the Job Hunt early, for better or worse.
* How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?  It made me alot more interested in Full-Stack positions, and granted me the confidence to feel that I could provide value in those roles.
* What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?  Leveraging the community for support, and not being afraid to ask for it when I need, while also providing it when I am able to.  ALSO, lightening talks are my jam, and I now have the skills to make them a part of my brand. 

[SLIDE SHOW](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/SlideShow/tree/master)

#### The presentation should not only be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).

## Submittal

* Students will submit a pull request of their markdown document to the [Turing Portfolios Repository](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios) no later than 8:30 am on Thursday of Week 6.
* The pull request will add a single file in a directory with their name in their cohort directory and will be named with the date, their name, and their module (e.g. `/students/1801-back/jeff-casimir/20180301-jeff-casimir-m4.md`). Pull requests that change/delete the existing template, or add/remove/edit other files will be closed.
* The markdown file should include a link to your 30-day post graduation action plan.
