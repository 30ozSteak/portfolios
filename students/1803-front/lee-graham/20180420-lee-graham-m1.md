# Lee Graham - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

REPITITION! REPITITION! REPITITION! I was determined not to reference in old projectf for the production of new projects.  In doing so, I discovered the multitude of ways in which a problem could be solved.  Coding in multiple languages, and allowing those languages to interact is like a dance to me, and Icluding some projects that were not assigned to me.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3.5
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3.75
* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment
I think that I passed.  But, I look forward to finding out exactly how I scored on each of the 3 segments of the pentathalon.
### -Dom Manipulation: 3.5
  I was able to switch from vanilla js at the start of my project, to jQuery, in an effort to save time.  Although I practiced for the exam in vanilla, I completed it live in jQuery with no problem, which made me extremely proud of myself.
### -Mythical Creatures: 3.25
  I prepared for mythical creatures by doing all of the old AND new creatures a multitude of times, and saving my unpassed tests for pairings, whiting out the old passing code and exploring different ways of passing the prototype function tests.  In the exam I struggled a little at first with applying the object literal's dot notation, but I eventually got it, and feel that my work flow was relatively on par with how I prepared.
### -Static Comp Challenge #3: 3.0
  I slayed this challenge.  I'm known for having tacky colors on my comps, and for leaving out details. As a result, I decided to stay true to the comp and all of its stylings, and specificities. Because of how high the level of extraness usually is in my comps, in terms of styling, there are usually a few things that don't work in my code by the time things get pushed to github Pages.  I was happy with the exactness of my comp in comparison to the given comp.  I did, however, struggle with some squirreliness in the mobile layout, but nothing that couldn't easily be fixed with a bit more time and attention, which left me ever confident that my original planning around the layout was sound. 


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The first 4 projects presented here were design challenges, to help sharpen our css skills.  They were also a great tool for practicing accessibility integration.  The objective was to recreate the comp exactly. The last two projects were focused on strengthening my skills in JS.  The first of the two was a an assigned project written in Vanilla.  The last of the two was one that I'd constructed on my own, just to get the repitition of html, css, git, github, and my hubmle initial attempt at implementing jQuery in a project.

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

We were challenged to recreat this comp, but given artistic license with images and color pallet.

Static Comp 1

Horrible contrast between the main icons and their background colors.  Great responsive, but missed the last section on the mobile version.  When the phone switches to the mobile version, the photo that is rendered at the bottom would be better styled at the top of the layout.  Background shadows on the words looks cloudy and messy.  Not Accessible.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/llg-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

We were challenged to recreat this comp, but given artistic license with images and color pallet.

Horrible colors.  Give it a max width for larger screen sizes.  Center cards, while keeping them left justified. Poor Accessibility.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/llg-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

We were challenged to recreat this comp, but given artistic license with images and color pallet.

Make the Tablet into Header/Paragraph groups, and then take the flex off.  Fix the OPEN button group in the mobile option. Better Accessibility, but should use aria-labelledby or aria-describedby to employ longer alt and aria-label attributes.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Create a working relationship and plan of attack with another person in an effort to meet common goals in creating functional webpages using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, GitHub, localStorage, JSON, and the optional use of jQuery.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/LinkList)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Create a webpage that allows a user to enter a title and a url that will be added to a card which is appended to the side of the same page, allowing the user to create a visual page of scrollable bookmarks that can be cued visually once read, or deleted. Storage was not used in this project.

Feedback from my partner, Brian Weikel :
  "I enjoyed working with my pairing person on the Linked List project.  My partner was more advanced with his knowledge of JavaScript than me, so I was able to learn from him.  He was able to explain concepts to me that we utilized so that it could better understand their purpose. When we encountered differences in working styles, we were able to work through them and press forward with the project.  We used the driver/navigator approach for much of the project and found it worked well for us.   It would have been more beneficial for me to have my partner navigate and me drive during times when I was uncertain of the correct coding approach so that I could absorb the information during keystrokes."


#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TwirlingGoddess/BoxIdea)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Create a webpage that allows a user to enter a title and an idea that will be added to a card which is appended to the bottom of the same page, allowing the user to create a visual page of scrollable ideas that can be cued visually once the quality level was changed, or the idea was deleted. There is also the opportunity to edit the title and idea texts. This information would be sent to local storage in real time and persist on the page upon reload.

Feedback from my partner, Brian Tiedt:
  "I really enjoyed working on this project with you. The lines of communication were always open. I appreciate all the hard work you put in to our most recent project. Your jQuery knowledge was paramount to making this project constantly move forward and progress to the finish line. You have a good concept of what we are learning and I think you are making great strides toward your goal of completing Turing and on to a career in development. Continue to listen and have patience with your fellow humans and I have no doubt success will follow.
  Thank You,
  Brian Tiedt"


#### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marikaross/todobox-pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Adopt the pre-existing code of an IdeaBox project, a webpage that allows a user to enter a title and an idea that will be added to a card which is appended to the bottom of the same page, allowing the user to create a visual page of scrollable ideas that can be cued visually once the quality level was changed, or the idea was deleted. There is also the opportunity to edit the title and idea texts. Convert the project into one that logs the title and errand that one has 2do.  Quality is changed to level of importance, among other changes to the original comp. This information would be sent to local storage in real time and persist on the page upon reload.

Feedback from my partner, Marika Ross:
  "I LOVED working with you!  Your calm, but focused, energy was very helpful to me throughout the project as I navigated my own personal existential crisis.  You are great at  explaining your thought process as you create new code and that is so helpful to me as a beginner.  I think our only difficulty stemmed from me being an early bird and you being a night owl so we wanted to work at different times, but I think we both worked to accommodate one another's needs. Thank you for helping me with keyboard shortcuts and reminding me of them when I tried to use a slower method.  And thank you for inviting me to the Lady Coders event.  And thank you for being such a wonderful, compassionate human."


## D: Professional Skills
In Module One, career development is focused on strategies to help students be successful at Turing. The following are key components of this success:
  Cultivate Self-Awareness
  Understand one's key strengths
  Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
  Ownership over one's learning
  Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
  Express one's own story and strengths
  Manage stress effectively

### Gear Up

#### Mental Health 101
##### Reflection:
* How have you been monitoring your window of tolerance? I feel as though proper preparation for the day ahead and the anticipation of the myriad possibilities that can come along with living in a city the size of Denver is key.  Starting from waking up from a good night’s sleep; into a morning routine of exercise, good food for breakfast, and self care rituals (meditation, makeup application), and music/reading/or podcasts, can all help start the day in a centered/regulated state.  Starting in that state allows me to easily notice observe when my state has fluctuated up or down throughout the day from my normal regulated state.  The more consistent I am with that morning ritual, the more active that I am in the process of truly knowing who I am and what my needs are for myself and my own zen, prior to going out to interact in the world, it’s spontaneous conditions, and it’s cast of characters.  I can then gauge whether places, spaces.
* Do you have specific categories you need to focus on while at Turing? I would like to continue to self-regulate by moderating my caffeine intake better.  I have very real levels of hypo-arousal that take place when I encounter verbal or physical violence from strangers in public, which is a common occurrence for me.  I’d love to implement breathing exercises to start regulating those WHEN they happen. Last mod, I struggled, and reached out for help when I was discovering that substance abuse had become my coping mechanism for stress.  It was helpful in allowing me to pinpoint this behavior and also in acknowledging how this behavior wasn’t serving me well and subsequently putting me in more stressful situations more often.  I believe that mindfully and intentionally seeking accountability helped me to get to this place of productivity and progress. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap:

##### Reflection:
I attended the LadyCoders conference to get a better understand what the women in our industry are feeling about this gender gap, outside of the obvious realities.  One perspective that I found valuable was the organizer's experience of being the only and the lonely.  She attested to being treated well by the men, but still feeling microaggressions by being present for conversations that disregarded her presence and made for awkward interactions.  As a queer person of color, I can relate, and find an intersection between ensuring my own space in the workplace alongside that of people of a female identified gender.



## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I often helped my fellow classmates with further understanding of html, css, and js.  I cleaned on days that were not mine.  I've had long chats with the security, insuring their emotional health was in tact.  Kind, courteous, and appreciative to the cleaners at night, knowing that they rarely get to interact with people from the Turing family.  I also leveraged my mentors and developed awesome relationships with them.
