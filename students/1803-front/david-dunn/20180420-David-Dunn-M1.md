# (David Dunn) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into mod 1 with a rudementary understanding of html, css, and javascript, and a desire to solidify and build my knowledge. My goal was to excell in each challenge and really step up the volume of my coding practice. Also, it was important for me to establish a routine and get used to lifestyle revolving around the Turing program.

#### Number Guesser

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Here we were tasked with building a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100, and providing feedback. I was able to build out 2 player and leveling up functionality.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The paired projects assigned this module created a new set of challenges. Working with another person on a codebase was a new experience and not all of my pairings went equally well. The git/ github aspect of each of these projects forced me to get better and deepen my understanding of the workflow. I enjoyed the progressive JavaScript challenges, and especially using local storage.

#### (Linked-List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dsdunn/linkedlist)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

For Linked-List we had to build a form that would collect website urls and titles, and dynamically generate them on the DOM.

Feedback to me:
I enjoy working with David. His technical knowledge helped us work through this project efficiently. He was flexible with work times and very considerate. My only piece of advice is that because David is so technical adept, there were a couple of occasions where he implemented code or changed code to something I didn't fully understand. However, when I asked questions, David fully articulated and explained his rationale for the changes. I would suggest that David explain his thought process while making adjustments. Finally, when we hit technical difficulties, he approached the problems thoughtfully and strategically. He ensured the success of our project. 

#### (Idea-Box)

* [GitHub link](https://github.com/dsdunn/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project involved building a form to collect ideas, rating them dynamically, sorting and filtering through them, and having them persist across sessions using local storage.

Feedback to me: 
Devoted to the task and very adept at JS. More frequent communication and voicing of thought processes would've allowed me to offer more help with the harder aspects of the project, but the ambition is appreciated.

#### ToDoBox 

* [GitHub Link]()
* [Original Assignment]()

For this project, we started with someone elses code, and had to refactor and pivot it's functionality.

Feedback to me:
I feel lucky to have worked with David. His command of javascript, jQuery and CSS is impressive. If there was an issue, he always has a good idea of what needs to be changed. More often than not, the solution worked the first time. Despite his depth of understanding, he was slow and methodical with his explanations and thinking. During our time together, he really helped me develop my understanding of the complexities of JS and jQuery. The only piece of feedback I would provide is there were times where the complexity of our code went beyond my understanding. If I did not ask for clarification it became difficult for me to read the code back. Prior to our evaluation, David took the time to go through each line of line-by-line to make sure we both had a thorough understanding of what was happening. If something didn't make sense, we refactored to make it more intuitive. This increased my ability to read what was happening and will likely lead to an improved code.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health 101)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

The mental health gear up session got me thinking about how well I recognize and manage stress, not only at Turing, but in life in general. It was interesting to learn about different responses to stressfull situations and how varied they can be. It has helped me to recognize signs of stress in myself, and practice awareness and patience. 

#### (Working Styles)
* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

The week 2 gear up about working styles helped my to understand the range of personality types and working styles. I felt like I was somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, and can relate to both ends, depending on the day. It was interestig to hear others' perspectives in group talks and hear about their experiences.

#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)
* [Github URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

Coming from a completely different work environment, I was unaware of the challenges faced by women in the tech industry. The video clips we watched provided an interesting perspective and history of women in computer science. The session definitly grew my awareness and perhapse a glimpse of some of the things I can expect to see once I get a job.

#### (Fake News)

The mod4 hosted session about fake news provided a compelling forum for exchanging our thoughts on the subject. The session leaders did a good job giving us an overview of issues regarding fake news and encouraged us to explore the many gray areas of the topic, ranging from what is fake news to who is responsible for controlling it. The spot the fake news game was fun, and the session really got everyone thinking.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I've been supporting the Turing community by actively participating in class and PD sessions, as well as by pairing with other students. I've made the effort to be supportive to my fellow classmates and not hesitate to reach out for help from the more experienced when I get stuck. Also, I've been active at a turing meetup over the weekend and on slack.
