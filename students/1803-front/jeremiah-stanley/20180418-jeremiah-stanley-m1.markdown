# Jeremiah Stanley - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I applied to Turing because I wanted to work in web and app development. I've spent most of my career in technology 
and I had a general familiarity with HTML and CSS, but I had never touched javascript. I really wanted to learn how 
to work in javascript, and have a better understanding of how code is structured and how it operates.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I was really intimidated by the project that we had to do. The number of projects we were given, and their 
complexity was incredibly daunting. That said, I have an odd love for tedious things and I also love learning 
new things, so I was excited to get started. 

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/js-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Static Comp Challenge 1 - don't you mean the Window's 10 Start Menu? In all seriousness, this 
comp was a lot of fun for me. I really enjoyed learning CSS flexbox and grid (#grid4lyfe) and how 
shifting grid and flex properties can make responsive design much easier. Mistake: I spent too much 
time making this comp fun. Don't do that. Fun is overrated. Fun is the worst.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/js-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This static comp challenge is comprised of a top nav and a series of cards. In all honesty, this 
project felt easier than the first challenge. However! I made a horrible mistake. Instead of making 
the images on my cards background images - I made them regular `<img>` tags, which meant I had to 
use absolute positioning on  all of the elements sitting on top of the images. Nightmare. All in 
the name of that stupid flipping animation. 

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our push into javascript and DOM manipulation, and damn, that first step was one hell 
of a doozy. I remember just staring at my computer screen just thinking. "What the hell is this nonsense?" 

Magic. Black magic.
Somebody has a goat somewhere. 

Anyway. Number Guesser is a game application that gives a user feedback based on their input. 
The user has the ability to define their own range or play two players. AND! There's confetti if you win. ðŸŽ‰

### Projects

I've honestly always been super wary of group projects. The bulk of my history with group projects has been 
uneven workloads and group partners slacking off. However, I have really enjoyed my introduction to paired 
programming and working on projects with the members of my cohort. 

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is a web application that a user can access to compile a list of web bookmarks for later viewing. 
This project introduced the concepts of `this`, dynamically generated page content, and event bubbling and 
delegation. I really enjoyed this project; working with David was definitely a highlight. He really helped me get a
 jumpstart on understanding jQuery.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmarler2/ToDoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox is a web application that a user can access to compile a list of their greatest ideas. AND! It 
persists on page load. This project introduced the concepts of local storage, JSON, and array prototype 
methods. I liked that this project  was truly functional, in the sense that I could host this code somewhere 
and someone could presumably use this application.

#### 2DoBox - Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmarler2/ToDoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

For me, 2DoBox was less about the project itself than it was about learning how to approach someone else' 
codebase. It was  an incredible challenge to honor the integrity of someone else's code. I think my initial  
response would have been to burn it all down. I feel like this project gave me some insight into what it will be 
like to work on code that I didn't write, and why developer empathy is so important.

### Gear Up

This mod we began to cultivate the soft skills that will eventually help us in our development careers. While I sometimes
went to these sessions begrudgingly, I can definitely see their value and how they will help us in our professional lives.

#### Week 1: Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

We began our gear ups at Turing by discussing mental health. I'm a pretty high-stress person, so, 
beginning my time at Turing with this gear up was probably I good thing. I think that this gear up
helped me remember the unproductive things I do to help me manage my stress. The reality is that Turing
is really intense, so I think it was really valuable to reflect on all of the different ways to approach
 and manage stress under a heavy workload. 

#### Week 2: Working Styles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

During this session, we discussed the multitude of different working styles that people have. We lined 
ourselves up on a spectrum from extroversion to introversion. Having a baseline understanding of where
people are coming from helps me understand what I need to do to give my peers the best possible chance
of being successful and making a contribution to my cohort myself. I can use my strength of initiator to 
activate others and leverage their abilities. 

#### Week 3: Code Debugging The Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Representation and equality are values that I hold really strongly. I really appreciate that Turing is so 
focused on creating an inclusive and representative space. I think that the clips of the documentary 
that we watched really helped me understand the pitfalls of the development community and how much more 
work needs to be done for the technology sector to truly represent the people that are using their products. 

#### Week 4: Social Movements and Fake news, Mod 4 facilitated

This gear up was really fun and entertaining, I really enjoyed watching the mod 4 students lead their own
gear ups. We dove into the complexities surrounding fake news, responsibilities of the technology industry,
and the concerns around censorship and free speech. Ultimately, this is a really complicated problem that 
doesn't have any easy answers. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I made stickers for Code Fair! Just kidding, but also, sort of serious. I have enjoyed getting to know the 
community here at Turing and learning from my peers and the mod 2 students. I hope that next mod I'll be able
to help the new batch of mod 1 students through pairing, fielding random questions, and maybe even leading a 
session on mythical creatures.

I also enjoyed being a part of the QueerQoders, and I hope to be more involved with them during next mod.
