## Areas of Emphasis

I'm driven to create a foundation of knowledge for which I can build a bright future in programing. More specifically I hope to learn about structuring a solid web design utilizing HTML CSS and JS. I also am looking to gain a strong grasp on JS and how to implement it most effectively.

## C: Group Work & Projects

## D: Professional Skills



### Gear Up
#### Health & Wellness: Stress

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

This was a great opportunity for me to explore what others do to manage stress especially during their time at Turing. I learned that time boxing and making sure to pivot frequently is a great method to manage your time and stress levels.

#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

It was very enlightening to hear about the struggle that others have when they are in a underrepresented group. I found that some of the status were shocking and it definitely made me aware that there is change that needs to happen so everyone has equal opportunity in this field and in other fields.

#### Smartphones your civil rights issue

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up)

We spoke in depth about the current issue with Facebook being in court under review of their public policy and how they share personal information. It was very interesting to see how exposed we are and how blindly we give away your personal information and then in turn it is spread around the internet.

## E: Community Participation

Supported my fellow students in their time of need by helping them work on projects and answer questions. Also helped to create fun environments for my peers during out group outings.

### Playing a Part

I cleaned up dirty dishes in the kitchen on a few occasions.
