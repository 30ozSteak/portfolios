# Nick Edwards - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal in this module was to gain experience in building full-fledged web apps as part of a team. The teamwork experience was my main takeaway from this module, and the technical practice has been very valuable as well.

## Self-Assessment

* **D: Professional Skills**: Pass

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Based on the 3s and 4s in my final assessment, and based on my own judgment of my knowledge, I passed. However, I received a 2 on ActiveRecord queries based on the one query that was evaluated, and I already have learned about what I did wrong and how to improve by sticking to Rails conventions more rigorously. Although I do feel confident with ActiveRecord and I think that this particular score was a fluke on my part, I plan on studying and practicing ActiveRecord queries in depth over the intermission.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I am pleased with the balance of individual and team work that I was able to achieve during this mod. I think that this experience has been invaluable in preparing me for working independently and as part of a team once I join the workforce.

#### Educational App

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nickedwards109/educational-app)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project)

I did an independent project to make an educational app that would allow instructors to create lessons and students to take those lessons. Although I followed a rigorous test-driven approach and I completed enough work to be comfortable showing it to employers, I did not complete the functionality I had intended to. It was a hard lesson in managing scope of a project and maintaining the focus on meeting a deadline. I plan on doing more work on this app during the upcoming intermission.

#### Blogger

 * [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/blogger)

This tutorial was instrumental in solidifying my knowledge of many Rails concepts including MVC,  ActiveRecord relationships, database schemas, and REST.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Bikeshare

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/limsammy/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share)

In this project, our 4-person team made a Sinatra app for analyzing data from the Bay Area Bike Share program. This project was an excellent exercise for learning about the MVC pattern and data analysis in a team context.

Our evaluation was positive. We received 3s on Functional Expectations, ActiveRecord, User Experience and Conventions, Code Organization / Quality, and Testing. We received a 4 on Working Collaboratively.

Our evaluator noted the following points:
 * Ran into issues right at the end. Weather dashboard broken. 2 hr extension to address. UPDATE: resolved.
 * Tests very solid. Dashboard tests missing.
 * Model tests solid.
 * Controller very clear. Organization solid in general.

The feedback my team gave me was that I was a good collaborator and a hard worker. I will continue to do my best to actively develop these strengths.


#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nickedwards109/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop)

In this project, our 3-person team built a fully-functional e-commerce app. By using Critical Path Methods to outline the work to be done, we were able to divide work effectively among our team and finish the minimum requirements several days ahead of schedule. This allowed us to implement extensions such as Stripe integration and search functionality. We are very pleased with our team workflow and the outcome of this project!

(evaluation scores)

My team provided me feedback saying that I was an effective project manager with a good balance  between planning too much and planning too little. This approach enabled us to have a plan and stick to it when necessary, and update it when necessary.


## D: Professional Skills

I found this mod's Gear Ups to be very valuable in terms of clarifying how we can leverage our strengths in teams together, as well as setting a high bar of expectations for empathy and collaboration.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I took the initiative to do a presentation on REST in Rails, because I was already familiar with the concepts and I knew that it would be beneficial to other students for them to have some extra reinforcement. I also actively reached out to Mod 1 students to offer my time for pairing. Although I only did one pairing session with a Mod 1 student, it was very helpful for him and I'm glad it was valuable for him.
