# TOM SOUCIE - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to go from having solid Ruby skills to being able to use
Ruby to actually build tools to view and store data. The power of utilizing data and the Internet of Things is really fascinating to me, so understanding more about how this functions and how I can build tools for this is an exciting experience. As I go forward and continue to improve skills, I want to branch out to the IOT if possible and continue growing and developing my technical and professional skills.

This module was a really good learning experience for how much work it really take to be successful at Turing. I was able to get a great intro to Module 1 through Mike Dao's Second Shift program, which allowed me to be successful right away. Module 2 started off with all brand new topics for me, so from the start I have always felt behind. The only way I was able to keep afloat in the class was through countless hours of work, and I would try to make myself in the building for at least 12 hours a day during the week. I want to keep up this habit and continue improving my ability to work and learn for sustained periods.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

The Turing community is one of the most important components of the educational system, so I wanted to contribute more this module. I had wanted to get involved with the Turing podcast, but due to the struggles I faced early on in the Mod, I decided to focus as much of my time as possible on studying and getting through the module. Even though I was not able to support the podcast, I did attend all Armstrong spikes, except for a Friday Spike for Factory Girl which I subbed in. Going forward I want to continue being a part of Armstrong, and hopefully get more involved and use Armstrong posse to give back to Turing.
