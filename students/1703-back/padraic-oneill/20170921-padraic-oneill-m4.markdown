## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
 - Webpack was challening in that the configurations were new to me. It was difficult to understand not only what webpack was doing, but how it was doing it.
 
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
 - The lessons were helpful and going back over them while setting up the server was the process I used to get webpack into place. Also, Ben's help was invaluable.
 
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
 - Working with Ben Jacobs has always been fun and tackling these challenges with him was great. Getting webpack to do all the things and coming to a greater understanding of the inner workings was a good feeling.
 
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
 - I used CSS3 animations to create a dynamic food list, however it wasn't implemented in the final code due to the length of time it would have taken to refactor the existing HTML and ajax calls. I learned more about DOM traversal and feel pretty solid with that. Lastly, I have a decent understanding of Express and configuring a Node server.
 
* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
 - I would spend more time understanding how things are working/communicating rather than focusing on getting them to work and moving on.
 
* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
 - It presented the opportunity to theorize on how things are working under the hood. It was a great experience overall, and I feel like it went more smoothly than prior, similar experiences due to our collective experience in learning new things together.

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?


## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
