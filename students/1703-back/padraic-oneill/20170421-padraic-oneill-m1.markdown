# PADRAIC O'NEILL - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

It was clear from the start how intense the Turing program would be. I tried my best to maintain a forward progression, while consistently trying to strengthen the foundations of my skills. I focused on OO programming principles and developing good practices, step by step. I became comfortable with creating Modules, Classes, and methods, and am continuing to develop a knack for sending objects back and forth. TDD has also been a primary focus point, and the more I used it the more value I gain from it. Alongside coding, I also made time for self-reflection to question my habits and call out my preconceived notions or judgements of other people. This is the first learning environment where I feel age isn't a factor in my ability to interact with other students.

### Pair Feedback

#### Project 1 (Adam Gunther):

**Feedback for Adam Gunther:**

I’m grateful to have had my first pairing project with you. I felt like we were often on the same level as far as experience and skills, but more importantly in terms of our dispositions and ability to communicate. These factors made the experience smooth and productive. There were times when I became frustrated with the code and its unwillingness to do what we wanted, and I could tell that you picked up on that. Part of that frustration was that we were running out of time. In retrospect, I would have preferred if we’d worked on Sunday, but I followed your lead and agreed to take Sunday off. We probably would have made a lot progress ton that day and that may have resulted in us finishing the project before the wee hours of the morning. I’d suggest trying to use the weekends to be as productive as possible since there is less pressure, and it’s usually the beginning of the project. Instead of sharing in my frustration you were able to forge ahead and get us to the next level, when we then could share a little victory. Your fortitude was a big part of our success as a team.

**Feedback from Adam Gunther:**

Overall, the pairing went smoothly. We took on the driver/navigator role which worked well, because we found ourselves to be at the same level of skill and found it was helpful for us to articulate our thought process to each other. It was easy to get along with each other, even during struggles. It was a nice way to relieve fatigue to switch from figuring out how it should be coded to/from how it should be approached. We were each aware we had a lot to learn to get the project completed, but welcomed the challenge positively, and certainly learned a lot. Upon retro, we were very much on the same page as far as problems/opportunities for improvement.  We failed to adhere to the rubric/scaffolding which caused lots of refactoring down the road, which made us lose sight of the full scope of the project. We did not sketch/diagram/pseudocode or discuss our overall approach once we started and began to abandon TDD when it became crunch time. Moving forward, it's clear a working program needs to be done two days before the due date to save a day for refactoring. The pairing was worthwhile, each member did their part, and when the struggle was real, each of us came through with creative solutions.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset



#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

At this point, I'm not really managing, but just going full steam ahead into a very dark abyss. Well, that's how I currently feel about this question in this moment. So, I suppose that this is a challenge. The idea of management seems to be more about breaking things up into small pieces. To section out one's work in, say, farming, is necessary, and arguably a natural human tendency, developed over thousands of years. However, when learning emerging or complex things, it doesn't always come naturally to me to manage the tasks. Section the topic into sub-sections, learn each, and then put them all together.

#### Session 3: Introvert vs. Extrovert

At first I had an issue where'd I feel inadequate when others finished exercises before me. I think I had a fixed mindset. Since, I've focused on developing my skills and asking questions, which has led to good progress and no more worrying about the other people.

My challenge in maintaining a growth mindset has been in empathy. I feel like I default to a me-centric point of view. As an introverted-ambivert, I can act as a good intermediate between the opposite ends of the spectrum. I can perceive the inner frustrations of anyone, well not really, but I mean...some people.

I heard that extroverts need communication because they don't always know when an introvert is needing alone time. This is somewhat crazy to me.

#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

What brought you to Turing?
I'd had enough of the life I'd been living where I try something new and get excited about it mainly because it is/was new. The "new" brings challenges, which is inviting, but in that it's easy to forget about enjoyment of the career.

What lenses or identities do you view the world from most?
Possible ethnicity/culture. I enjoy learning about people's backgrounds and cultures. I think it's important to have a sense of someone's past so that you can have a foundation to building a view of the person's future. I don't think it's necessarily right to ignore ethnic and cultural backgrounds because we are essentially a human community and that includes our entire selves.

What values drive you?
Often, charity and goodwill drive me. I like to help when I can, whether it be a monetary donation or volunteering my time. I get a boost from recognizing I can do things that help other people.

How do I demonstrate those values?
I try to get out into the community and find a good cause and attend to it. I'll typically find a non-profit and volunteer. Also, I'll try to be grateful as society expects, but also take it up a level if I am able.

Could other people identify your values?
I think my friends know of my charity and people new to my life soon learn I'm not out to put anyone down or make jokes at the expense of others.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

How are your experiences at Turing similar/different?
The percentage of women in classes at Turing seems well above the norm for the industry. I haven't seen any blatant disregard for women, but I do realize that I may not see what others see.

What role do you play in creating a more inclusive environment?
I try to maintain a laid-back, talk to anyone attitude that I think helps me connect with more people, regardless of gender or color. Our cohort has one or more people representing a range of gender, race, and sexual orientations. It's easy to see that I can in fact, connect with all of these people without really thinking about their race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Brainstorm a specific situation you've witnessed or heard of at Turing that's similar to the movie.
I'd heard about some guys talking out loud, around women, about some inappropriate topics. The girl who related this story was obviously triggered when repeating it for this conversation. I don't think I'd participate in that kind of blatant disregard for the qualities of women. I can imagine what the guys were talking about, and there's something just plain rude about that sort of childish bullshit.

### Community Participation

During my weeks at Turing I've helped a couple of students a lot in their studies. I enjoy the type of mentoring opportunities I've had just as student somewhere near the middle of my cohort's current abilities set. I've attended the Wozniak spike several times and learned a lot about data structures. I've also spent many hours with a professional mentor, Peter Carr, who has helped me on almost all of my individual projects, taking me slowly through the concepts and making sure I find the answer on my own. Step by step, line by line.

I think I've contributed positively to the community at Turing. I have tried to branch out to other mods and students in the other cohort, and have gotten to a friendly basis with many.
