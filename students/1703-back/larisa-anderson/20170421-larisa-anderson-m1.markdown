# LARISA ANDERSON - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Finding my balance. Balance I feel is a struggle for most throughout life. I knew before coming to Turing I would need to let go of feeling the need to DO everything. This is MY TIME. I gained so much perpective when learning about "Growth Mindset", it helped me tremendously. I feel that at the end of Mod 1 I finally began to trust myself. You are smart, you CAN do this. The tools at Turing are amazing, the support is unparrelled to anything else I have ever been apart of. That being said, the tools to learn Ruby have been great. Learning and implementing TDD has not only helped my understanding of Ruby basics, but has come up in other areas of my life where I need to take a step back approach and ask those importnant questions to get the answers I need.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Chantal Justamond):

**Feedback for _Chantal_Justamond:**

When I found out I was paired with Chantal, I felt a wave of relief sweep over my body. How lucky was I to be paired with such
and understanding, smart, and friendly person. 
We made our DTR, and we both knew that because of my lack of experince it was going to be a tough project to both feel that
we we're going to be able to contribute equally. 

We started out working together, and we decided that we were going to divide and concour. Looking back I feel that this wasn't
the best way to start our project. Reason being is I needed to be able to see the ins and outs of the code to help me 
understand the problem. 
I started to work on the project with Dave Maurer, and invited Chantal to work with us. We decided that we should stop moving
forward until I was able to catch up. I am not sure if this was the best idea for the project, but it made sense at the time. 

Chantal, 
I really appreciated your work on the project. You were very commited to finding the answer to the problems. I know that this 
dedication to coding will take you far. You also have a great gift in pateince, and believe me I know all about patience. 
Had you been a partner that wasn't able to take a step back and genuinly 
care that I was apart of the project it would have turned out badly for us both. 

**Feedback from ____Chantal Jsutamond:**

During the week of our pairing project I saw how invested you are in learning and even though you say it's not clicking believe me it is, Your brain is doing the job in the background, one of this days you will have that elusive AHAA!! moment that we all love. Also I would like to add that maybe for your next time, take into consideration the type of person your partner is, since you are an extrovert and I'm an introvert I felt pressured to work in your style instead of the way that works the best for me. I do have say that when we divided our tasks, me the key-maker , Larisa the Offset generator, you did a wonderful job reaching out to the right people and fulfilled the job in timely manner, communication is also one of your strengths to be proud of. Lastly, I would like to add that I'm very proud of your performance during our evaluation, it showed how much you've learned.
