# Natalia Colome - M3 BE Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Get comfortable consuming and producing APIs, building data analytics through ActiveRecord and SQL and take the opportunity to start experiment with other technologies or rails functionality. Also, to start allocating time to preparing for the job hunt, do an interview prep and focus on any area I might need to improve (how 'something' works, coding challenges, communicate what/why I'm doing, etc) to have a better opportunity of getting a job.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Apicurious - Github

* [Apicurious](https://github.com/nmcolome/apicurious_github)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)

Description

- Consume the Github API to build a simplified version of the website's UI while using the OAuth protocol to authenticate our users with Github and using BDD and TDD. 
- Stack: Ruby on Rails, Omniauth gem, Github API, SASS, CSS, HTML

Learnings

- Consuming a third-party API
- OAuth protocol
- Use of BDD (and later TDD) to drive development

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamgunther1/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

Description

- Use of Ruby on Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.
- Stack: Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord

Evaluation Comments

- Very good documentation.
- 'Further Testing' of documentation was a bit confusing because of the order of the indications. Change order.
- The serializer formats the output of the API. Instead of dividing by 100 and rounding in the SQL query, do this format change in the serializer.
- Move views/queries that are common between all models to ApplicationController or ActionController, eg. Random
- Take time to change our SQL queries to ActiveRecord to get the practice.

#### Cloney Island

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/cloney-island)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)

Description

- A remake of Sygic Travel, visitors can click on a city and see tourist attractions in that city, ranked by prominence. Visitors can also click on the filter navigation links to sort into restaurants, libraries, museums, and more. To plan a trip, visitors can sign in, enter their trip details, and then start planning their itineraries for each day of their holiday by adding attractions to their trip. Vendor accounts have the ability to create "Tours" which, ultimately, visitors will be able to view, review, and 'buy.' Cloney Island also has admin accounts that can sign up vendors, disable user accounts, and access high level stats about users.
- Stack: Javascript, SASS, CSS, Postgresql, Rails 5.1.2, Ruby version 2.4.1, Google Places API, Google Maps API & Twilio API.


Evaluation Comments for my User Story (Live messaging with ActionCable)

- Really nice attempt at a challenging story.
- There were no tests for messaging or conversations at all
- Definitely some refactoring opportunities but overall nice job

Description

- Dropbox with a twist. Based on Grab Bag (Dropbox clone), now besides uploading files you can also get information from them. From your prefered adjectives to where you take your pictures and the camera you use. Also, if you login through Facebook, we can tell you who you're biggest followers are, how many reactions and comments you get, who you hang with and where you go.
- Stack: Java, SASS, CSS, Postgresql, Rails 5.1.2, Ruby version 2.4.1, Facebook API, Facebook OAuth.

## D: Professional Skills
Focus on preparing for the job hunt process. In order to do so, I did my flower exercise, my resume draft, started a trello board to track companies and my interactions with them and built my action plan for mod 4. Overall they all helped to have a better idea of what I want out of a job, how to communicate this and have a sense of direction on what to do next

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions

I really enjoyed this gear up, we had a very interesting and open discussion. We talked about how hard it is to respond to this, because they can be intentional or unintentional, and the best way, we could think of, to handle it was asking questions about what do they mean or responding with a joke or light sarcasm to make light of the situation but still have a response to it. Microagressions are based on assumptions and stereotypes and because they're small comments they're very hard to respond and easily pile up with time.

#### Allyship

My main take away is that being an ally is not a noun, it's a verb, it requires action from you. Say something, ask, learn and spread that knowledge within your community. I think it comes back to what we talked about in microagressions, about how to handle this situations and highlighting the importance of doing something so I think it's valuable to reinforce the tools we've learned throughout our time in Turing to handle conflict and stand up for ourselves and others when we need to.

#### Choose your own adventure: Being a Newb in Tech (aka Don't be a Selfish Bastard)

My main take away is that even though I might not feel ready to contribute to a community, I currently have all the resources and knowledge necessary to start helping others. It was very valuable to be reminded of all the different ways we can start contributing: leading a lunch and learn, post or answer a question in slack or in twitter, contribute to open source, pair, write and post a tutorial, volunteer at a meetup/conference or simply telling our story on how we started our tech careers and motivate the people around us.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Throughout the mod I felt there was more collaboration between frontend-backend, specially now when we're starting to use new languages and push ourselves even more to be as hireable as possible.
And I really enjoyed that even though we aren't using the same languages, I could still help them based only on the concepts and the same the other way around.

I'm also on the process of writing a tutorial on how to build a real-time chat with rails and action cable, since I wasn't able to do it for my project and I really want to be able to build it.
Most of the tutorials I found didn't applied to what I wanted to build so I think it's a very interesting opportunity to contribute.
