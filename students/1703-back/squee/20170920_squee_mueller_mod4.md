# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

I'd like to spend this inning proving my ability to learn and use JavaScript. I have enjoyed working in it so far, and I think I'd like to look for fullstack positions as I go into my job search.

By graduation, I would like to feel ready for my job search. I would like to feel like I could competently contribute to a team of developers.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

Testing. We would get stuck for hours on testing.
Join tables. We had to do a ton of research on join tables to get them to work.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

Testing: refactored functions to enable as much unit testing as possible. Checked our solutions on Postman to work around testing foibles.
Join Tables: We had to research error messages and unpredictable behavior. Validate behaviors by testing in Postman. We validated the process by clicking around in the app and using developer tools to log what was happening at each step in the process.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

Working with Natalia. She's the best.
Learning how to use the debugger. JS is NOT as intuitive as Ruby and it felt great to discover how to communicate with it.
Also, I discovered that I love Front End. I came in with some conceptions of what front end is and how I felt about it. I was stoked to be proven wrong as we played around with JQuery on the front end. ;D

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

Event Delegation
Event Bubbling
Unopinionated nature of JS...
Seeing the whole process of building an API for our own consumption
Seeing how all the elements come together with Node, Express, Knex, etc...

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

I would slow down and be less excited to start solving problems. When I'm working directly with someone, I usually check in with them to create an approach that we both like. When I'm working on my own, I tend to want to dive in and find solutions to problems immediately. This usually means I didn't read the instructions very well and end up having to go back and redo some of my work.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

Awesome. I loved getting to work with Natalia. She is quick and clever and keeps hacking at things until she finds beautiful solutions.

Generally, I think paired learning speeds up the process for both people. If I don't understand something, there's a chance my partner does and then they can help me. It's a safety net for both people. Plus, comradery.


## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

I think the biggest feedback I've received has been to slow down and fully understand the problem before I start trying to solve it. I've received this feedback several times, and each time, I think I do get better at taking a deep breath before starting. That said, I'm fighting my nature on this one... One of the things I really like about the mock interviews is the practice of talking about problems with potential employers. As a result of these experiences, I've started employing the same techniques in pair coding. Before Natalia and I would attack each problem, I would ask her if I understood the problem correctly and would give her an approach that I thought might work for finding a solution. We would then work together to make that solution happen. I think I am improving, I just still have more work to do.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
