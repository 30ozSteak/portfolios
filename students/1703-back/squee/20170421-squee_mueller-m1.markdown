# squee mueller - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to go deeper into a programming language and create more complex programs than I have in the past. I wanted to be introduced to concepts and styles I hadn't worked with before or hadn't had a reason to explore in greater depth. I wanted big projects that would push me to practice the skills I was learning. I really wanted to start to find my place in the Turing community and start to develop relationships with the other students in the school.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/homework/blob/master/credit_check.rb)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

Write a program that can detect mistakes in a credit card number.

- Dynamic, modular solution - made reaching that extension a breeze!
- Great work building modular methods with (mostly) single responsibilities
- There is some logic that could be further extracted into separate methods, though
- For example, within your multiply_by_two method, split_long_number(cc_number).reverse could actually be its own method, responsible for reversing the split number
- Another refactor to start aiming for is not daisy chaining your methods as much, and designing your program's methods to know less about each other. We'll start looking into strategies for this together in class soon.
- Lastly, would love to start seeing you push towards using classes throughout your programs - again, we'll be pushing this practice more soon.

Fundamental Ruby & Style:
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Functional Expectations:
4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.


#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

Use a linked list to make a pseudo drum machine on your computer.

- 28 tests, all passing
- really great tests
- Watch for making things depend on other things
- start with no access and then add reader and accessor as necessary

1. Functional Expectations:
- 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development:
- 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 
- 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Styled:
- 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion:
- 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques


#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

Build a REPL version of Battleship. 

- Application does not run, has many disparate pieces, but not connected.
- Overall, well written and clean.
- Get around wrangling complex conditionals with predicate methods
- Would like to have seen user feedback pulled out into a module

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Enumerable & Collections
- 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

3. Test-Driven Development
- 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

4. Git Workflow
- PASS: Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

5. REPL Interface
- 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

6. Breaking Logic into Components
- 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

7. Functional Expectations
- 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/enigmatic)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

Create a tool for encrypting and decrpyting messages. Add in a crack feature if there's time.

- 45 tests, 15 failing
- Great use of modules
- look into how to use constants to store information that does not change
- logic broken up well
- application does not run

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
- 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

2. Test-Driven Development
- 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

3. Breaking Logic into Components
- 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

4. Overall Functionality
- 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

(feedback to me)

Squee, thank you for being a great pair on the Enigma project. From the very beginning you helped to foster a collaborative and enjoyable environment. You are really good at logical thinking, breaking problems down to small manageable pieces, and putting in the required effort and time to finish a project. These skills, combined with your positive energy and kindness towards others, will undoubtedly make you a great software developer/teacher. I think we both agree that we missed an opportunity to learn more about how to use git during this project, as we didn't want to spend too much time trying to figure out our many git issues. Though we found workarounds for git, I think we both recognize that git is a tool we need to learn to use more effectively. Other than that, I think our personalities complimented one another and we both made valuable contributions to the project. Thanks again for being a joy to work with.


#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dianawhalen/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/headcount)

(Intro)
DTR from Enigma: https://gist.github.com/squeemishly/60eb14a0dcb2aed06982e93168df6a04

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I love the concept of Growth Mindset. Growing up, I'm pretty sure I had a fixed mindset. Most things came easily to me, so when something was actually challenging, I didn't know how to approach it. It wasn't until my last job, especially when I started to learn to code, that I learned how to learn. I think Growth Mindset is really just an infatuation with learning. Once you love to learn, you may face stumbling blocks and frustration, but you'll keep coming back. 

I've had many 'not yet' moments already in my time in Turing. I'm just feeling much more patient and INFINITLY more confident that yet will happen. :D

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL]()

I don't think I've been intentional enough with my learning process in the past. I'm trying hard to be more intentional with my process while I'm in Turing. I'd like to rewrite the story I tell myself that I'm not good at studying...

I also love the concept of exposure; that immersing yourself completely in something you want to learn will be the best way to start. However, it's been my experience that nothing will cement knowledge quite as well as teaching it. As I've gotten more confident with the materials we've learned in mod 1, I've been extending myself to help people who need more support. That has made me a significantly better coder.


#### Define the Relationship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/dtr_guidelines_memo.md)

The document students are given to guide the conversation is so helpful. I loved that I essentially had a checklist to run through to make sure I wasn't missing something that needed to be hashed out up front. It helped to guide how I communicated with my pair partners as well as what we were each able to give to the project. :D

#### Working Styles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

There's so much discussion - online and in life - about how to accomodate an introvert in social situations. It never really occurred to me to worry about the extrovert's experience. I just assumed "They like people! They must be comfortable working with all kinds of people! Done!" But man, they still have specific needs. I know this sounds really foolish, and after this session, I felt like a total tool for not even considering it. But man... That was an eye-opener! 

#### Strengths and Storytelling

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

A large part of what will help us get jobs once we finish Turing is being able to nail the interviews we receive. Part of nailing those interviews is appearing competent and confident. We spend our time coding to learn to be competent, but that doesn't necessarily change the way we present ourselves. The number of students in the class who were uncomfortable with putting 'software developer' as their career on Linked In is telling to our ability to present ourselves. Until we get used to seeing ourselves as software developers, we'll never be able to sell ourselves as developers to potential employers.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

The thing that always confuses me about sexism/racism/any sort of group marginalization is that there are still good people think they don't exist. I'm also confused as to why women getting equal pay in the workplace is considered a 'women's issue' when it's men who have to make the changes... 

Anyway. The tech industry is sexist. I'm not at all surprised. That's part of why it's crucial we have as many women as possible going out into the tech world. Let's make it normal that women have these jobs. Let's make it so people don't look at me with surprise when I say that I'm a coder. It seems like the idea has been out there for a while, now let's make it a reality.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Strengths Finder Reflection

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_session.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

I really connected with the strengths I got. They made me proud to be the person I am. They also helped me to understand what it was that I was able to bring to a pair project.

#### Learning to Pair

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

It's crucial to have expectation conversations up front. The DTR document is a wonderful tool to fascilitate those conversations. Also, there's several different primary styles of pairing. Don't get stuck on just one. Try out different methods of pairing and see if one works better than another for each partnership you have.

#### Feedback

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/feedback_i.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

I love that we have a session on how to receive feedback. It's such a crucial skill. I'm a particularly blunt person in most circumstances and can always use the reminder about both how important it is to give good feedback as well as how to couch it in a way that is more palatable. 

One thing I would have loved to see in this session was some focus on how to receive feedback. Giving feedback is crucial, but it's only useful if the person receiving the feedback knows how to receive it. It's not personal, it's one method to help you grow as a person/developer.

#### Developer Identity

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/developer_identity.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

Main takeaway: I have to work on my social media presence. ::grimace::

Part of getting a job as a software developer is having a robust online presence. I barely exist online. It's time for me to start thinking about how I change that. This is actually the first thing I've come across at Turing that has made me feel like maybe I won't be able to get a job when I get out of school...

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Yohannan, you were absolutely fantastic to work with. I really appreciated so many aspects of working with you.

First, when I was having problems thinking through what belonged in our code, you started by just giving me the answers or pointing out where I was going wrong. I asked you if you could give me a minute to think things through before telling me the solution. You actually looked like you got excited that I wanted a challenge and that I didn’t want to rely on you to get the work done. I know we could have done some things faster if you’d just given me the solution, but it was important for me to get some of those processes hardwired into my brain without help. Thank you.

There was also your compassion around my need for breaks. It is really important for my brain to take breaks. Every time my brain started to get sluggish, I would ask you for a break. Every time, you would agree without hesitation. It made me feel safe in telling you when I was struggling and when I needed to buckle down and focus. Thank you for understanding my needs in that.

Also, you are so great at asking for help. I tend to buckle down and want to try everything I can think of before I ask for help. I want to work for the solution myself. You were great at recognising when that was getting us nowhere and seeking out additional support that could get us back on track. It made us move much faster and dramatically decreased the amount of frustration we both ended up experiencing with the project.

I was also so grateful for your motivation to find solutions to questions we had about our project. I would get so caught up in finding a solution to problems that I discounted how important it was to learn more about the side things. The fact that you sought out how to build Modules and included them in our project was a saving grace. It not only improved our score on our project, but it filled me with so much happy to see such a cool tool! That turned into a major motivator for me to ask more questions of our other classmates to see what else I could learn. Thank you for setting such an awesome example in engaging with your curiosity for curiosity sake. That was beautiful.

The only thing I can think of that might have made you a stronger partner for me to work with would be holding me accountable to the things that I can find work arounds for. Git was a struggle for us. We both just wanted to give up on git and get the project done. But I think that part of that lesson was about getting us to figure out a git workflow. We missed that lesson when we just got frustrated with git. I think if one or both of us had been more insistent that we needed to figure out git and solve our problems with it, we would have gotten much more out of that lesson. But even in that, I was so appreciative of your patience and cool-headedness. That was so enormously frustrating!

All in all, working with you was a fantastic experience. I appreciated your patience, chill nature, experience, and enthusiasm. You brought so much to the team, and I know that you will continue to contribute enormously to your future teams as well. :smile:

### Playing a Part

For most of this mod, I was really focusing on getting my footing under me. Around week 4, I started feeling more comfortable here and had an idea about how I fit into the larger group. At that point, I started to more actively reach out to the people who I knew were struggling. I wanted to be able to support them as they learned more about coding and how they fit into the Turing community.

I've already started talking to Erin about being a co-host of Imposters Lunch for next mod. That weekly meetup has been enormously beneficial for me, and I'd like to be able to use it as a conduit to help the next round of mod 1 find their place in Turing.
