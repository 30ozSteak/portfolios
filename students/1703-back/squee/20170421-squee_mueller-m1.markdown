# squee mueller - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to go deeper into a programming language and create more complex programs than I have in the past. I wanted to be introduced to concepts and styles I hadn't worked with before or hadn't had a reason to explore in greater depth. I wanted big projects that would push me to practice the skills I was learning. I really wanted to start to find my place in the Turing community and start to develop relationships with the other students in the school.

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)


#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/homework/blob/master/credit_check.rb)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

(description)
Write a program that can detect mistakes in a credit card number.

(evaluation comments)
- Dynamic, modular solution - made reaching that extension a breeze!
- Great work building modular methods with (mostly) single responsibilities
- There is some logic that could be further extracted into separate methods, though
- For example, within your multiply_by_two method, split_long_number(cc_number).reverse could actually be its own method, responsible for reversing the split number
- Another refactor to start aiming for is not daisy chaining your methods as much, and designing your program's methods to know less about each other. We'll start looking into strategies for this together in class soon.
- Lastly, would love to start seeing you push towards using classes throughout your programs - again, we'll be pushing this practice more soon.

(evaluation scores)
Fundamental Ruby & Style:
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Functional Expectations:
4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

(description)
Use a linked list to make a pseudo drum machine on your computer.

(evaluation comments)
- 28 tests, all passing
- really great tests
- Watch for making things depend on other things
- start with no access and then add reader and accessor as necessary

(evaluation scores)
1. Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills all base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Styled
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion
4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques
