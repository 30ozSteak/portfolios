# squee mueller - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to go deeper into a programming language and create more complex programs than I have in the past. I wanted to be introduced to concepts and styles I hadn't worked with before or hadn't had a reason to explore in greater depth. I wanted big projects that would push me to practice the skills I was learning. I really wanted to start to find my place in the Turing community and start to develop relationships with the other students in the school.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### Credit Check

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/homework/blob/master/credit_check.rb)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check)

(description)
Write a program that can detect mistakes in a credit card number.

(evaluation comments)
- Dynamic, modular solution - made reaching that extension a breeze!
- Great work building modular methods with (mostly) single responsibilities
- There is some logic that could be further extracted into separate methods, though
- For example, within your multiply_by_two method, split_long_number(cc_number).reverse could actually be its own method, responsible for reversing the split number
- Another refactor to start aiming for is not daisy chaining your methods as much, and designing your program's methods to know less about each other. We'll start looking into strategies for this together in class soon.
- Lastly, would love to start seeing you push towards using classes throughout your programs - again, we'll be pushing this practice more soon.

(evaluation scores)
Fundamental Ruby & Style:
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Functional Expectations:
4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/jungle_beat)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

(description)
Use a linked list to make a pseudo drum machine on your computer.

(evaluation comments)
- 28 tests, all passing
- really great tests
- Watch for making things depend on other things
- start with no access and then add reader and accessor as necessary

(evaluation scores)
1. Functional Expectations:
- 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development:
- 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 
- 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Styled:
- 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion:
- 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/battleship)

(description)
Build a REPL version of Battleship. 

(evaluation comments)
- Application does not run, has many disparate pieces, but not connected.
- Overall, well written and clean.
- Get around wrangling complex conditionals with predicate methods
- Would like to have seen user feedback pulled out into a module

(evaluation scores)
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

2. Enumerable & Collections
- 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

3. Test-Driven Development
- 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

4. Git Workflow
- PASS: Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

5. REPL Interface
- 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

6. Breaking Logic into Components
- 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

7. Functional Expectations
- 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/squeemishly/enigmatic)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma)

(description)
Create a tool for encrypting and decrpyting messages. Add in a crack feature if there's time.

(evaluation comments)
- 45 tests, 15 failing
- Great use of modules
- look into how to use constants to store information that does not change
- logic broken up well
- application does not run

(evaluation scores)
1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
- 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

2. Test-Driven Development
- 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

3. Breaking Logic into Components
- 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

4. Overall Functionality
- 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
