# squee mueller - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to go deeper into a programming language and create more complex programs than I have in the past. I wanted to be introduced to concepts and styles I hadn't worked with before or hadn't had a reason to explore in greater depth. I wanted big projects that would push me to practice the skills I was learning. I really wanted to start to find my place in the Turing community and start to develop relationships with the other students in the school.
