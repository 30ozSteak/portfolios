## Areas of Emphasis

> Toward the end of this module I really felt like I found my stride. I kept hearing Josh talk about students having this "fearlessness" that I did not feel I had until now. Especially in the last project, I started taking risks, accepting tasks I wasn't sure how to complete, and asking for help (for me, the hardest of them all). I felt like I had a handle on a whole lot more than previously, and suddenly I had the confidence in areas that I was unsure about. I still have things that I want to work on, writing better tests being one of them. However, overall this mod has been one of significant growth.

>* I don't think that my end of module assessment score is a good indication of my skills. I have never been a very good test taker and although I forsee this being an issue in the future, it is still a problem I have yet to solve since childhood.
>* The group projects I had this mod were a blast. Both taught me things and were quite fun for different reasons.

## Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>
>* A store engine where we built our own custom API. We used serializers to customize our data which was formatted in JSON.  
>
>* It was really interesting takng a dive into complicated Active Record quieries, and to some degree SQL quieries. In hindsight, it was a great introduction into APIs and taught me how to understand and parse the data coming in from our custom calls.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)**
>
>* A remake of Sygic Travel, visitors can click on a city and see tourist attractions in that city, ranked by prominence. Visitors can also click on the filter navigation links to sort into restaurants, libraries, museums, and more. To plan a trip, visitors can sign in, enter their trip details, and then start planning their itineraries for each day of their holiday by adding attractions to their trip. Vendor accounts have the ability to create "Tours" which, ultimately, visitors will be able to view, review, and 'buy.' Cloney Island also has admin accounts that can sign up vendors, disable user accounts, and access high level stats about users.
>* It was an absolute pleasure working with a team of women to conquer and solve programming issues. I felt very comfortable talking through bugs with my group, and everyone was supportive of one another. My personal feature was implementing a filter bar that made a call to the Google Places API and replaced a keyword to the desired filter feature. I also took on the task of solving a detrimental security issue. That was challenging, but I am proud to say that I accomplished it without making major changes to the code base.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**

>* We cloned Kickstarter for sprint two. After fixing some errors present in the brown field code we moved on to our personal features. Mine was adding progress bars to each project to visually display the the amount a given project was funded. From there my task was to use ajax to filter the results by paramaters such as end date and most funded.

>* Takeaways from the project is that I really found my voice. Cloney Island part one prepared me for this sprint. I was more willing to talk about what I was doing, help other students out, and try and do my best work. The code I wrote with Javascript was challenging, and if I had more time I would learn more.
