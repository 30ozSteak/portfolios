# ADAM GUNTHER - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with a focus to learn how to build powerful, robust web applications. I've had experience with HTML, CSS, JQuery, but lacked the skill to customize the backend of websites. I've been very intrigued by the development of the blockchain and attended all armstrong spikes that focused on the blockchain and the emerging Ethereum technology built on the blockchain.

### Pair Feedback

#### Project 1 (Padraic O'Neill):

**Feedback for Padraic O'Neill:**

> Overall, the pairing went smoothly. We took on the driver/navigator role which worked well, because we found ourselves to be at the same level of skill and found it was helpful for us to articulate our thought process to each other. It was easy to get along with each other, even during struggles. It was a nice way to relieve fatigue to switch from figuring out how it should be coded to/from how it should be approached. We were each aware we had a lot to learn to get the project completed, but welcomed the challenge positively, and certainly learned a lot. Upon retro, we were very much on the same page as far as problems/opportunities for improvement.  We failed to adhere to the rubric/scaffolding which caused lots of refactoring down the road, which made us lose sight of the full scope of the project. We did not sketch/diagram/pseudocode or discuss our overall approach once we started and began to abandon TDD when it became crunch time. Moving forward, itâ€™s clear a working program needs to be done two days before the due date to save a day for refactoring. The pairing was worthwhile, each member did their part, and when the struggle was real, each of us came through with creative solutions.

**Feedback from Padraic O'Neill:**

> Hi Adam,

I'm grateful to have had my first pairing project with you. I felt like we were often on the same level as far as experience and skills, but more importantly in terms of our dispositions and ability to communicate. These factors made the experience smooth and productive. There were times when I became frustrated with the code and its unwillingness to do what we wanted, and I could tell that you picked up on that. Part of that frustration was that we were running out of time. In retrospect, I would have preferred if we'd worked on Sunday, but I followed your lead and agreed to take Sunday off. We probably would have made a lot of progress that day and that may have resulted in us finishing the project before the wee hours of the morning. I'd suggest trying to use the weekends to be as productive as possible since there is less pressure, and it's usually the beginning of the project. Instead of sharing in my frustration you were able to forge ahead and get us to the next level, when we then could share a little victory. Your fortitude was a big part of our success as a team.
