## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \In a 4 day sprint, a partner and I built a Rails based API that analyzed sales data to formulate useful business intelligence. The application is a versioned API serving up serialized JSON, integrating advanced ActiveRecord and SQL queries, and utilizing Single-Responsibility controllers.
>* \Teh project was fast a furious, but in a short amount of time I felt competent with generating a RESTful API, custom routing, and serialization. I also felt much more comfortable with SQL and ActiveRecord by the end.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
\I was not able to attend the gear up on microagressions. I did however ask fellow students what their opinions were. It seems useful to identify a microagression when they occur and try to utilize sarcasm or humor to point out to the ridiculousness of the comment. This is important to do when microagressions are pointed towards myself or when I witness them between others.
