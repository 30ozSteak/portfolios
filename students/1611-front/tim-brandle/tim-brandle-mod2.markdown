# Tim Brandle - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for Mod 2 was to become familiar with React and SASS. Mod 2 turned out to be a surprise for me and was not what I expected. I've left Mod 2 with much more than an understanding of React. My biggest take aways this mod are more confidence in array prototypes, object oriented programing, test driven development, recursion, and algorithmic thinking

### Receiving Feedback

**Ciara Bujanos**

Tim was very patient and took his time to make sure my partner and I understood what we were writing and helped guide us in the right direction when we got stuck. I also really appreciate that on my first project you had a full plate as well but made time to help me figure it out.

I honestly didn't notice anything that I thought could have been better. Thanks for  being so patient!

### Playing a Part

I have made an effort to attend all of the Turing events and guest speakers. Helping my classmates work through problems and explain concepts is another way I was able to contribute to the Turing community.
