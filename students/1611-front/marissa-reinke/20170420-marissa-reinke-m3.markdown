Marissa and I partnered on the first project of the mod. She was a great person to partner with. She is great at problem solving and is always open to trying different ways to solve a problem. She's also really good at referencing the docs or old projects to help find a solution. She was flexible and great at collaborating and working through problems. We partnered well together and I always felt like she had my back! She can get a little frustrated with herself like us all but she is good about walking away to refresh and always makes sure I do to. Can't wait to work together again!

#### SWAPIbox

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

#### Movie-Tracker

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!
