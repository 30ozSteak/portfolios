# Marissa Reinke - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary objective was to continue to add onto my fundamental javascript skills. I also wanted to begin to branch out into the Turing community now that we are all in the same building! 
Going into mod1 I feel good about what I have accomplished throughout the mod with algorithmic thinking and problem solving.
The thing I want to continue on getting stronger at is definitely getting better at reading the docs. 

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how *YOU* would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Development**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Projects throughout mod2 that were done solo. 

#### SortingSuite

* [SortingSuite](https://marissa27.github.io/sorting-suits/)
* [SortingSuite Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying Computer Science data structures and algorithms. They give us an opportunity to focus on algorithms of various complexity all solving a relatively simple problem.

In this project, you are challenged to implement three fundamental sorting algorithms.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: Sorting Sweet
# Instructor: Nathaniel
# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.


#### FlashCards

* [FlashCards](https://marissa27.github.io/flash-cards/)
* [FlashCards Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/flash-cards.html)

In this project, you’ll write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

In order to build good habits, we’ve broken the project up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility. As you work through each iteration, use TDD to drive out the desired behavior.

# Evaluation Rubric
## Project:
## Instructor:
## Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 2.5: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Projects done with classmates in mod2 FE

#### (2DoBox-Pivot)

* [2DoBox-Pivot](https://marissa27.github.io/2-do-box/)
* [2DoBox-Pivot - assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

You will be inheriting someone’s previous IdeaBox and pivoting it over to 2DoBox.

Your projects will utilize webpack & its awesome development server.

Keeping accessibility in mind we will be grading you based on how accessible your application is.

# Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox
# Instructor: Nathaniel Foster
# Comments:

# Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

# Accessibility

* 3.5 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.

# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

# HTML Style

* 3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Utilization of es6

* 3 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature does and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of mismatching es5 and es6 style in any specific file.

# Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

# Workflow

* 3.5 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

#### (Weathrly)

* [Weathrly](https://marissa27.github.io/weathrly/)
* [Weathrly - assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

In this project you will be getting your first real interactions with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of your application.

## Specification Adherence

3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS/Sass Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints
