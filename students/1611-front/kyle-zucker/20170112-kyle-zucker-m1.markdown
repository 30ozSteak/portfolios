## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Here are some things I've done by myself

#### Comp Challenge 2

* [Link](https://zkc.github.io/KZ-comp-challenge-2/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zkc/KZ-comp-challenge-2)

A lovely example of CSS. I'm fond of the side-scrolling navagation icons on the top. I finally started to feel comfortable with positioning and flex-box after this project.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zkc/NumberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Guess the Number! I enjoyed building the UI and adding in extra features. 

Evaluator: Louisa

UX/UI Expectations

4: Application matches comp exactly. There are no omitted details. Any extensions are intuitive, well designed, easy to use, and in keeping with the visuals outlined in the comp. Virtually no major improvements are needed in the UX or UI.
Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three
Fundamental HTML

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
Fundamental CSS

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Fundamental JavaScript

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


## C: Group Work & Projects

Here are some things I've done with other people

#### Steve the Squirrel (Game Time!)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marissa27/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

Steve needs to get his nut back home! Guide Steve thru the perilous Nutcracker infested forests. This project increased my love of objects in js.

Evaluator: Bree

Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
Code Sanitation

3 - Five or fewer complaints

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub Pages](https://zkc.github.io/IdeaBox/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zkc/IdeaBox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

I've got an idea, let's box that up. This project was a good continuation of pair programming experience. 

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Workflow needed conversation in PRs and no one should consistently merge their own PR
Shared classes in CSS had repetition
Liked the use of constructors and objects, not sure it was necessary because it felt "heavy", but good practice with objects
Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
HTML Style

3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Collaboration

2.5 - Team members shared equitably in the workload, however there are only a few pull requests, which are not labeled or documented very well.

#### Linked List

* https://github.com/zkc/Linked-List
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

I need a link! Good thing it's on this list. This project was my first experience pair programming. The discovery of event bubbling was thrilling.

#### DTR
##### Project: Game Time
##### Goals and expectations:

Kyle hopes to use github better, use it constantly/consistently, come out with a good game
Kyle expects: base game to be completed and solid
Kyle: to have a solid product then be able to mess around with other features
Marissa hope to learn more complicated jquery and set deadline/track progress
Marissa Goal: have a fun game that I am proud of to show people 
Marissa expectations to learn a lot 

##### Schedule Expectations:

When are we available to work together and individually?
Both say evenings are best time for working, save mornings for small fixes or pairings if needed 
Communication Expectations: How and how often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?
Kyle: always be in a place of knowing what the other has going on and at anytime be able to see what the other is doing and tie into milestones 
Marissa: ditto 

##### Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement:

Kyle strengths: messed around with JS stuff, the engine behind making it work. Will like to improve on design side – no clue where to begin
Marissa: I feel comfortable in design and css, keep getting faster at JavaScript and feeling more confident 

Workload Expectations: 
What features do we each want to work on?
Utilizing our deadlines and github to stay on top of stuff and so one person can’t break it all! 
Use lots of branching effectively



### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.
