# Pamela Lovett - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, my goal was to establish a strong foundational knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I came into the program having done just a small amount of coursework on sites like CodeAcademy. I completed all of the pre-work and also read Eloquent JavaScript in its entirety. Despite this, I still felt like there was much that I could do in terms of approving my understanding of all three things listed above.

## A: End of Module Assessment

#### DOM assessment
Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Hesitant to using math to calculate the tip percentage
Good grasp of jQuery syntax
Needs to practice more with passing information through function arguments
Rubric

Progression/Completion

3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
JavaScript Style

3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
Workflow

3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
Collaboration

3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


####OOP Assessment

Evaluator: Louisa

Notes:

Overall, good job. Got hung up a few small things, so make sure to review/solidify the basics moving forward so the basics aren't using up braincells that could be going towards solving harder problems.

Rubric

Progression/Completion

3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
JavaScript Problem Solving

3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity, and can effectively leverage documentation
Workflow

3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
Collaboration

4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individually, I completed the following projects:
* Penguin Party
* Mythical Creatures (on Centauy)
* Static Comp 1 and 2 - (3 will be finished in the next week)

#### Number Guesser

* [https://github.com/thatPamIAm/number-guesser]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html]()

We were required to build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Similar feedback I saw for everyone I evaluated:

Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)
UX/UI Expectations

3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.
Functional Expectations

2.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One
Fundamental HTML

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
Fundamental CSS

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Fundamental JavaScript

2.5: Application runs but the code is confusing with unnecessary or poorly named variables, functions, and unclear organization, structure, and/or duplication

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Staci McWilliams 1611FE

I have worked with Staci on a number of occasions during class, and I am currently working with her on our final project for Mod1. Staci is extremely respectful and empathetic in her interactions with both myself and others in our cohort. She makes a very conscious effort to monitor her learning and adjust her study habits/workload due to her desire to have a deeper understanding of the material we are covering, which I believe is rare in others. Her love of learning goes past wanting to get "perfect" scores from a rubric, which I find very admirable. She has truly been a pleasure to work with throughout the course.

At times, I think that Staci can be too hard on herself.  We have discussed this a number of times, as I feel we both are similar in this way. She understands a lot more than she thinks, and she has mentioned that her self-doubt has caused her to not "speak up" during a few occasions in class or in pairings. I think this is a shame - as our cohort could definitely benefit from her thoughts and suggestions!

To Rebecca 1611FE

One of Rebecca's greatest strengths is her determination to do well and finish strong. She has a can-do attitude and is not afraid to reach out to others for help or clarification on things. She puts a great amount of effort into doing her very best at all times and does well with showing confidence in the decisions that she makes.

At times, I believe Rebecca's determination to do her very best personal work can sometimes overshadow the team dynamic. During both our pairings in-person and remotely, I believe this played a role in our struggle to find common ground to work together on tasks as team members.

To Sam 1610 FE

Sam is knowledgeable, patient, and flexible. While mentoring, he is great about asking questions to make sure that the people he is helping are actually grasping the material at hand. He is willing to take the time to help guide others to the "answer" without just handing it over - which is no small task!

To Franklin 1611 FE

Franklin is a very approachable person who is very eager to help and talk things through with others. Although we have talked quite extensively in class concerning lessons and in-class work items,  Franklin and I have yet to pair on an actual project. From what I've seen, he does a great job of going above and beyond the expectations of the project requirements.

I think Franklin's greatest strengths are his cheery nature, his passion for his work, and his willingness to help others. I wish I could offer something in the way of constructive criticism for Franklin, but I don't feel like any feedback I'd give would be as valuable as the feedback I can provide after having done a project with him.

To Krystin 1611FE

Krystin has a high level of self-awareness, which I find is not typical for many people. She is open and honest with herself and others about her biggest strengths and weaknesses, which I believe will serve her well during her time at Turing and beyond. Even though each of my project pairings have been successful in helping me grow in different ways, I can honestly say that my pairing with Krystin made the most difference in how I approach my work now. While discussing and "defining" our relationship for our paired project, I made it clear to Krystin how uncomfortable I have been with "driving" and "breaking" code on the fly... and how I thought this might be stunting my development. During our entire pairing Krystin not only honored my desire to take the extra time to really understand how our code was working, but she also forced me to drive more than I would have otherwise and constantly encouraged me to "break" my code.

I believe Krystin could benefit from taking more short breaks while working on projects. She is pretty good at doing this currently, but can sometimes get very involved and forget to giver herself some room to breathe.

### Being a Community Member

From Staci 1611FE

I have paired with Pam numerous time in classes and also on our final Mod-1 project Game Time. Pam is very quick to ask questions to clarify if she doesn't understand something and never hesitates to reach out when something is unclear. I think both of us were nervous coming into the project but Pam was very supportive of working as team and of my learning goals. She is also very proactive in acknowledging and working toward her own learning goals. I always enjoy pairing with Pam and she is very encouraging and positive. While sometimes she gets frustrated(like all of us), she is quick to implement a few plan and start tackling it. I was impressed by some of the solutions she came up with for our project. I think the next step for her would be to have confidence in her abilities.

From Rebecca 1611FE

You are a respectful person to work with. You are committed to understanding every line of code and how it all interacts together to function. In evaluation, you made a comment that you often doubt yourself and let that become apparent to the people around her. You should give yourself more credit because you know a lot more than you think you do. I have noticed you have been staying later after class to work on the more recent projects which will benefit you. I wish we could have had more time to work together in-person after class and over the weekend on our project than we did - I think that would have made our pairing more successful than it was. Overall, great work!

From Kyle 1611FE

Pam is great! I really love her ability to take the lead and start up class discussions.

### Playing a Part

Currently, I am an active member in the JC Society and parenting slack channels. Although I have only attended one coffee Tuesday for JC Society, my goal for next module is to attend at least 3 of the 6 that are set to occur during the six weeks. This module I also attended lunch roulette as went to posse meetups for Verou and Pahlka. I have joined the Armstrong Posse but have yet to attend a formal meeting due to spikes for Armstrong being cancelled.

I make an effort to reach out to those in my cohort by striking up conversation in and out of class that is related to class discussions as well as more informal things. I also use Slack as a way to stay connected to others in the cohort.

Despite it being optional to attend, I have made it a point to attend every Friday speaker (with just one exception.) I have managed to connect with a number of people from the BE program from these events as well as other mixers/special events that Turing has put together.
