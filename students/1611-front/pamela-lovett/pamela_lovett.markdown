# Pamela Lovett - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, my goal was to establish a strong foundational knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I came into the program having done just a small amount of coursework on sites like CodeAcademy. I completed all of the pre-work and also read Eloquent JavaScript in its entirety. Despite this, I still felt like there was much that I could do in terms of approving my understanding of all three things listed above.

#### OOP Assessment

Evaluator: Louisa

Notes:

Overall, good job. Got hung up a few small things, so make sure to review/solidify the basics moving forward so the basics aren't using up braincells that could be going towards solving harder problems.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individually, I completed the following projects:
* Penguin Party [https://github.com/thatPamIAm/penguin-party]
* Mythical Creatures (4 left to complete on Centaur)
* Static Comp 1 [https://github.com/thatPamIAm/static-comp]
* Static Comp 2 [https://github.com/thatPamIAm/pl-comp-challenge-2]
* Static Comp 3 (in progress)

#### Number Guesser

* [https://github.com/thatPamIAm/number-guesser]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html]()

We were required to build a game that allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 100.

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Similar feedback I saw for everyone I evaluated:

Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

UX/UI Expectations
3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

Functional Expectations
2.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

Fundamental HTML
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

Fundamental CSS
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

Fundamental JavaScript
2.5: Application runs but the code is confusing with unnecessary or poorly named variables, functions, and unclear organization, structure, and/or duplication


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I completed 3 group projects:
* Linked List
* Idea Box
* Game Time

#### Linked List

* [https://github.com/becs919/linked-list]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html]()

Evaluator: Louisa

Notes:

Well done, need to work on locking in details like indentation consistently. Had a slight lack of balance between both Pam and Becca sharing the JS and CSS writing. Used jQuery and Flexbox, which required some end-of-project refactoring to include. Good job taking risks!

Functional Expectations
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Idea Box

* [https://github.com/thatPamIAm/idea-box]()
* [http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html]()

Evaluator: Robbie

Notes:

Filter was not working, but implementation was close (jQuery each)
Good conversation in GitHub, but more of it, especially in the PR descriptions
Good JS - continue refactoring and breaking out logic into smaller, more readable functions

Specification Adherence
2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

HTML Style
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS Style
2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Collaboration
3 - Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.

## D: Professional Skills

####DTR from Game-Time Project with Staci:
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d91F_Zkfc9cOjwWXmQ0tqfYiUq85vkrha4xunop2tJ0/edit]

######What are your learning goals for this project?
Pam: Deeper level of understanding of the code; Increasing comfort in ‘jumping in’ and trying new ideas and things w/the code

Staci: To increase comfort level in JS and work on breaking down projects to the smallest piece and working from there. 	

######What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Pam: I prefer pair-programming (in-person when possible) with JS. I prefer working on HTML/CSS together in terms of planning… however, don’t mind the divide and conquer approach for ‘knocking it out.’

Staci: I prefer pair programming when programming JS or new concepts. Fine with divide and conquer on CSS/HTML. I can be flexible.

######How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Pam: I am fairly direct and to the point. I am very available on slack during nearly all hours of the day.

Staci: In-person is always the best. I like using slack and screenhero as well. I appreciate honesty in communication as long as it is constructive and delivered kindly.

######How would you describe your work style?
Pam: I like working independently and with a partner. I definitely like to “think things out” before jumping in. I have no problem reaching out to others after I find myself struggling with a problem.

Staci: Very collaborative, like to talk through problems and think out loud. I try to    tackle something myself but if I am not making progress I seek out help.

######What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Pam: Both of my projects have turned out to be great learning experiences. Past projects have taught me to stop being so gun-shy with the actual coding process as well as the need to speak up if I have a differing opinion on things.

Staci: Great learning experience. Was paired with peers who had a different  learning/communication style and was happy to be exposed to it. Felt my partners and I were able to be flexible with each other and learn from each other. Made new friends!

######What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Pam: I need to make sure that we both feel comfortable with getting enough exposure to all areas of the project. I think this can be done by working collaboratively together. I also need to vent.

Staci: I need a safe place where I can be honest about challenges. I really try to celebrate “wins” no matter how small. Open communication is very important and if there is a conflict I would want to resolve it immediately. 									

######What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Pam: I am VERY flexible remotely and have good flexibility for in-person meet-ups. I have no preferences for scheduling, especially over the X-Mas break. I do think my brain works better in the mornings, though. HA!

Staci: NA

######What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Pam: I am pretty direct in any feedback that I do give (which hasn’t been much these last few projects).

Staci: Not really in a place comfortable giving feedback in technical areas but am working on my comfort level there. I think giving and receiving constructive feedback is really beneficial and enjoy receiving it.

######What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

Pam: I could use improvement in both CSS and JS. I feel like my strength in JS is edging out my CSS after the last project, but not by much. I could use improvement in all technical areas. I think the best way my team can help support improving my skills is working together.

Staci: Strong communication/collaboration skills. Comfortable in HTML and somewhat in CSS. Avidly working on strengthening my JS skills. Very open to improving those in any way my partner suggests.

######What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Git/Github/Waffle/Slack

######How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
	1) Consult each other/pseudo code/write out ideas
	2) Google/Stack Overflow
	3) Consult peers/pairings

######How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Pam: For me, a project is successful if both team members walk away from it having learned something. I am more concerned that we both have a solid understanding of what is going on than getting a “perfect” project turned in.

Staci: If I feel I strengthened my technical skills during the project.
(3’s).  Teamwork makes the dream work!

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

####to Staci 1611FE (Game-Time)

I have worked with Staci on a number of occasions during class, and I am currently working with her on our final project for Mod1. Staci is extremely respectful and empathetic in her interactions with both myself and others in our cohort. She makes a very conscious effort to monitor her learning and adjust her study habits/workload due to her desire to have a deeper understanding of the material we are covering, which I believe is rare in others. Her love of learning goes past wanting to get "perfect" scores from a rubric, which I find very admirable. She has truly been a pleasure to work with throughout the course.

At times, I think that Staci can be too hard on herself.  We have discussed this a number of times, as I feel we both are similar in this way. She understands a lot more than she thinks, and she has mentioned that her self-doubt has caused her to not "speak up" during a few occasions in class or in pairings. I think this is a shame - as our cohort could definitely benefit from her thoughts and suggestions!

####to Rebecca 1611FE (Linked-List)

One of Rebecca's greatest strengths is her determination to do well and finish strong. She has a can-do attitude and is not afraid to reach out to others for help or clarification on things. She puts a great amount of effort into doing her very best at all times and does well with showing confidence in the decisions that she makes.

At times, I believe Rebecca's determination to do her very best personal work can sometimes overshadow the team dynamic. During both our pairings in-person and remotely, I believe this played a role in our struggle to find common ground to work together on tasks as team members.

####to Sam 1610 FE (Pairing)

Sam is knowledgeable, patient, and flexible. While mentoring, he is great about asking questions to make sure that the people he is helping are actually grasping the material at hand. He is willing to take the time to help guide others to the "answer" without just handing it over - which is no small task!

####to Franklin 1611 FE (Pairing)

Franklin is a very approachable person who is very eager to help and talk things through with others. Although we have talked quite extensively in class concerning lessons and in-class work items,  Franklin and I have yet to pair on an actual project. From what I've seen, he does a great job of going above and beyond the expectations of the project requirements.

I think Franklin's greatest strengths are his cheery nature, his passion for his work, and his willingness to help others. I wish I could offer something in the way of constructive criticism for Franklin, but I don't feel like any feedback I'd give would be as valuable as the feedback I can provide after having done a project with him.

####to Krystin 1611FE (IdeaBox)

Krystin has a high level of self-awareness, which I find is not typical for many people. She is open and honest with herself and others about her biggest strengths and weaknesses, which I believe will serve her well during her time at Turing and beyond. Even though each of my project pairings have been successful in helping me grow in different ways, I can honestly say that my pairing with Krystin made the most difference in how I approach my work now. While discussing and "defining" our relationship for our paired project, I made it clear to Krystin how uncomfortable I have been with "driving" and "breaking" code on the fly... and how I thought this might be stunting my development. During our entire pairing Krystin not only honored my desire to take the extra time to really understand how our code was working, but she also forced me to drive more than I would have otherwise and constantly encouraged me to "break" my code.

I believe Krystin could benefit from taking more short breaks while working on projects. She is pretty good at doing this currently, but can sometimes get very involved and forget to giver herself some room to breathe.

### Being a Community Member

####from Staci 1611FE (Game)

I have paired with Pam numerous time in classes and also on our final Mod-1 project Game Time. Pam is very quick to ask questions to clarify if she doesn't understand something and never hesitates to reach out when something is unclear. I think both of us were nervous coming into the project but Pam was very supportive of working as team and of my learning goals. She is also very proactive in acknowledging and working toward her own learning goals. I always enjoy pairing with Pam and she is very encouraging and positive. While sometimes she gets frustrated(like all of us), she is quick to implement a few plan and start tackling it. I was impressed by some of the solutions she came up with for our project. I think the next step for her would be to have confidence in her abilities.

####from Rebecca 1611FE (Linked-List)

You are a respectful person to work with. You are committed to understanding every line of code and how it all interacts together to function. In evaluation, you made a comment that you often doubt yourself and let that become apparent to the people around her. You should give yourself more credit because you know a lot more than you think you do. I have noticed you have been staying later after class to work on the more recent projects which will benefit you. I wish we could have had more time to work together in-person after class and over the weekend on our project than we did - I think that would have made our pairing more successful than it was. Overall, great work!

####from Krystin 1611FE (IdeaBox)

####from Kyle 1611FE

Pam is great! I really love her ability to take the lead and start up class discussions.

### Playing a Part

Currently, I am an active member in the JC Society and parenting slack channels. Although I have only attended one coffee Tuesday for JC Society, my goal for next module is to attend at least 3 of the 6 that are set to occur during the six weeks. This module I also attended lunch roulette as went to posse meetups for Verou and Pahlka. I have joined the Armstrong Posse but have yet to attend a formal meeting due to spikes for Armstrong being cancelled.

I make an effort to reach out to those in my cohort by striking up conversation in and out of class that is related to class discussions as well as more informal things. I also use Slack as a way to stay connected to others in the cohort.

Despite it being optional to attend, I have made it a point to attend every Friday speaker (with just one exception.) I have managed to connect with a number of people from the BE program from these events as well as other mixers/special events that Turing has put together.
