# Hugh Morrison - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I had done a fair bit of pre-work coming into Turing yet didn't feel as though I could contextualize the information that I knew. Meaning, there was no overarching framework in which I could add new tidbits of knowledge. And so, I knew close to nothing. My primary goal this mod was to create this foundation, to contextualize the things that I had learned before hand, and to solidify a solid base on which I could build more knowledge. Beyond all that, I wanted to take advantage all that Turing has to offer and wanted to integrate myself more fully into the community. I wanted to commit. And commit I did. I have found an accepting and nurturing citizenry and I feel as though I can certainly thrive here -  professionally and as an individual as part of a larger community.  

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

## DOM

### Notes

* **A: Some duplication with the input field keyup listeners, but you know where to improve and how to reduce duplication**
* **B: Overall, good grasp of jQuery and JS for DOM manipulation**

### Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

### Workflow

* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

### Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## OOP

### Notes

* ** Really nice job! Consulted the docs very effectively when he wanted to double check a hunch on how to proceed, was extremely collaborative and a pleasure to work with. Made good progress through the tests and wrote effective, thoughtful code. **

### Progression/Completion

* 3.5 Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### JavaScript Problem Solving

* 3.5: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity, and can effectively leverage documentation

### Workflow

* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development


### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod, we worked on a host of projects individually. Here, I will showcase my NumberGuesser application and some interesting CSS heavy static sites.  

### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hmorri32/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is an application that generates a random number on load. This number, initially is between 1 and 100 but I incorporated customizable input fields in which one could select their own range of numbers. The goal is to guess the number that the program generates. You are given hints if it is too low or too high and you must go from there!

#### Robbie's Evaluation Notes:

* Need to break out functionality of long JavaScript functions: pieces of code that have similar functionality can be grouped together and refactored to have cleaner, more readable functions throughout
* Naming of JavaScript variables and functions should be descriptive (so you can come back to the code much later and be able to understand what each piece is doing without running through all of the logic again)
* CSS needs to match the comp exactly for desktop and mobile view
* For HTML, take advantage of shared classes between elements that are styled the same way (try to get away from CSS selectors directly on elements, like buttons, because you will have buttons with different styles on the page)

#### Evaluation Scores

##### UX/UI Expectations

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

##### Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

##### Fundamental HTML

* 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### Fundamental CSS

* 2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

##### Fundamental JavaScript

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.
