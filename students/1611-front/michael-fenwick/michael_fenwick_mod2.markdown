## B: Individual Work & Projects

Three individual projects for Module 2 to benefit us prior to being introduced to React. The first one, flashcards was to practice making classes/class instances and have them communicate with each other.
The second was sorting suite, which was were we built 3 different sorting algorithms. Each one increased in complexity but also improve the performance.
The third was Complete me, where we built a Trie data structure where we could import the dictionary and use the tree as an auto complete.

#### Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


#### Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


#### Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.


## C: Group Work & Projects


### Projects

Two group projects for Module 2. The first one, 2DoBox-Pivot was a refactored ideaBox app with the implementation of es6.
The second one was a weather application which we built using React.

### 2DoBox Pivot

* [GitHubURL](https://github.com/Mickyfen17/2DoBox-Pivot )
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot)

#### Notes:

An app where you can save upcoming todo's to the application.
The todos should persist after page reload.
Same application as IdeaBox in mod 1 but with the added usage of es6.

#### Functional Expectations

* Loved how maintainable the tests were
  great use of for loops and how -v the tests were
  keep doing this it's going to set you up for some real success in the future testing is the key to writing good refactorable code.

* Loved the file organization
  helpers are super great! would love to see that
  great use of closures and helper functions
  I would like to see some of the files broken out.
  turn it into an object and call each function so you can test that inside of a file.

#### Specification Adherence

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

#### Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

#### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations


#### HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### JavaScript Style

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

#### Utilization of es6

* 4 - Developer has used more than one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature(s) does/do and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of the es5 style in their code left in the codebase.

#### Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.


#### Workflow

* 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Gender Gap in Tech

* [Workshop URL]()

The gender gap video that we watched has been something that has stuck with me ever since. It's obvious to see that the gender gap in the tech industry is wide.
My wife is a women who works in tech so I can hear first hand how difficult it can be in a still male driven industry.
I find Turing does a good job by providing a diverse gender ratio but feel that it won't be like that if/when we all find employment.


### Professional Development Workshops

#### Cold Outreach I

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i.md)

It took me until around week 8 of the program before I decided to reach out to a mentor. My main drive was to start to build a network in California. Now, having reached out, I have found it to be extremely helpful.
If I can met as we currently are and continue down the same path then I can see myself getting a lot out of the mentorship system.
I am still trying to build a network so I'm now on the lookout for further mentors to assist with that.

### Being a Community Member

#### From Leta Keane:

Working with you on two different projects was helpful. I appreciated that you listened and offered suggestions, instead of pushing us to solve a problem the same way you did. I thought you did a great job checking in and gauging the skill level of me and my partner, and you checked in to make sure we were following along with you. I appreciated your willingness to really look at our existing code to see how we were working, rather than just pulling up your code and showing us what you'd done. tl;dr 10/10 would pair again

#### From


### Playing a Part

I have attended multiple meet ups within the the Denver tech scene during the last 6 weeks. Most of the meet ups I've attended have been driven around how to get beyond the technical interview and secure a job.
I have also attended 90% of Iron FE's morning white boarding sessions and organized the FFE1 - FFE2 pairing sheet.
I also had a PR accepted for Mod1 Mythical Creatures repo where I enhanced some tests.
