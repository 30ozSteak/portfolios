# M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
Similar to module 1, my goal this module was to learn the skills as outlined in the Mod2 Expectations list.  Because it's easy to get carried away with tangential topics to learn and play with, I tried to stay focused on what the instructors wanted me to learn during this 6-week period. To do that, I spent a lot of evenings watching youtube videos on different concepts (MVC, DNS, Active Record, etc) and practicing any available repos, like Blogger or assignments in the Homework link online.  As a result, I feel like I have a pretty solid understanding of high-level concepts that were presented to us this mod.  Additionally, I believe I have been successful at navigating my way around a Rails web application.  Definitely my brain gets a bit muddied once the routes start getting really busy or the nested if/then statements in the controller/view get out of hand, but given enough time, I can usually find my way into a solution to a problem.  It's been fun working on projects that feel like real-life work assignments!  It's also been interesting/challenging learning to work on another person's repo, like in this final project.  I'm definitely not as good at that at this point and that is something I'd like to get better at in the next two mods.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
What I struggled with the most was learning Active Record and SQL.  It was great having access to the Obstacle Course to practice with but it still takes me awhile to come up with the solution to a more complicated query.  It's just so difficult to troubleshoot errors that occur when you get the query wrong.  I think I've relied heavily on access to great troubleshooting tools up to this point so it can be a bit frustrating not knowing how to fix a problem other than just throwing everything at a wall until something sticks. However, there is nothing quite so fulfilling as getting a db query working...total zen moments.  Otherwise, I continue to struggle with CSS.  I feel much better about HTML after all the practice in projects but..the CSS piece still needs some practice.

Summary (1-3 sentences):
Software programs created to work upon design internet protocols have followed suit in creating their own agreed-upon conventions and design patterns. One such design that weâ€™ll focus on in this article is an acronym known as MVC or Models-Views-Controllers. MVC strategically separates functionality of a web application into three components: business logic (controller), user interface (view), and database logic (model). Let's discuss each component separately, how they work together, and why utilizing MVC will help improve the web development process.

## ActiveRecord Obstacle Course

Was this helpful for practicing ActiveRecord?
Definitely helpful!  I would work on a few in a day, then leave it for a week.  Then I'd come back to it and TOTALLY forget how I completed the previous few so I was forced to re-learn the syntax and logic over and over..which was very helpful for me in solidifying the concepts.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite project was probably the LaughTracks project because it was fun creating a web application for the first time!  And just kinda fun watching comedians a lot...  Definitely the most frustrating part for me was the CSS.  I also enjoyed the independent portion of Little Shop because I enjoyed learning how to work off of someone else's code and try to troubleshoot solution to problems.  It was also a great learning experience to see how Ian solved a problem and trying to figure out why he solved it a certain way and how I could use that in future applications, ie: request.fullpath.split('/')[-1] == 'disable' or     allow_any_instance_of(ApplicationController).to receive(:current_user).and_return(@user)

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned that it's way more important to take pomorodos during the challenge because when you get stuck, you may not be able to rely on another person in the group to have an 'aha' moment.  Often those aha moments come after taking a quick pom.  I also learned that it's a bit easier making design decisions because you are the only person contributing to the project so you can quickly design a feature conceptually and then hop into testing/implementing.  It's also nice being on your own because you get the opportunity to work on every component/feature for the project so you get excellent practice in aspects of MVC, authorization, authentication, db queries, routing, etc.  When I got stuck, I also relied more on outside sources, such as my mentor, an instructor, or google.  

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?
I learned a lot more in my paired/group projects, in general, because inevitably my partners would know more about a particular topic than me and I got to reap the benefits of that knowledge.  It also took us longer to design a feature because we were using 2-3 brains and not one, so it often meant we talked through the feature MORE before implementing, which means we likely ended up designing a more effective solution.  It was definitely more challenging in that you would end up not working on all aspects of a project so you had to be careful that a change you were making to someone's else portion of code wouldn't break one of their tests or go against a design decision they had made elsewhere.  So we would often end up needing to talk more before changing major components, which means it took longer, in general, to implements stories.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I made quite a bit of coffee and cleaned up the kitchen/emptied the dishwasher quite a few times.  I also helped to lead the RunTime posse and was engaged in the Joan Clarke Society.  I also participated in the Apto's Hacktoberfest and I organized a group of my classmates to attend with me. I also completed all SAB surveys to provide feedback on how to improve the community.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I'd like to continue to be engaged with Runtime because its an excellent source of stress relief and a fun way to get to know other module students.  I'd also like to attend more JCS events next mod and maybe help to lead one.

### Member of a Posse

What did you do with your posse over this module?
We ran for 30-45 minutes during lunch on Mondays and Tuesdays
With JCS, my favorite meeting was when we had several female alumni return and give us the low-down on their current jobs.

What is your favorite thing about the posse experience?
For RunTime, my favorite part is just getting out of the basement and forgetting about the stress of school for a little bit.
For JCS, it's been great meeting female alums and making connections with them.  I am very much so looking forward to a self defense meeting next mod!

How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?
It's allowed me to network with more students and alumni I wouldn't otherwise get to meet.  As a result of a woman I met at JCS, I got to have lunch with her and tour her company which inspired me to attend the Hacktoberfest.
