Little shop. Build a app from nothing was a great experience also make my realize about abilities I need to improve.

* From LaughTracks I learn to relay on my knowledge to get the job done, I have to restrain myself to fall in rabbit holes when something was interesting to me, and my CSS skill are really bad (I never was to fond with graphic design). Overall was a good exploration on how to deploy a web app.

* little shop solo, After 5 weeks of few sleep hour, being sick and stress. I Feel could do more on regular circumstances. But it was good learning of my limits and some of my flows as a Software Engineer, I need to lower the rate I made typos and get even better on finding them. and even I didn't completed all the requirements working with code that order person write was a real life experience that will be helpful for the future

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?
* little shop and Book_club where good for team work. I both case I try to focus on my strengths to be a productive part of the pair or team. Several times I was having this internal dialog that I was as productive or efficient. But after the projects my team mates appreciate my efforts. I guest I wasn't giving my contributions the same value and is something that I'm glad to know so I can work on it.
Also I got great team mates/ pair
