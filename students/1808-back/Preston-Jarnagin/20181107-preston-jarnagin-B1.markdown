# M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
- I had never really built something for the web and had never really known what a framework was, let alone used one. I feel pretty confidant in using Rails now, so I feel like I was successful

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- All the new syntax and the large file-structure were probably my biggest stuggles. I was very uncomforatable about not memorizing all the new syntax and all the new commands, but I'm starting to learn that it's okay to go back and look up the way to do things, as long as I remember what the syntx is doing and where to find it. All the rails magic running in the background also made me uneasy. I'm learning to trust rails (or other tools) and instead of trying to understand what its doing, I can learn what inputs it takes and what output it gives.
- There was also a big mindset change I made during this mod. Mod 1 was more of a refresher/warm-up because I went into it with some previous experience. Mod 2 was a lot more work because it was all new material I hadn't seen before.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
- Favorite: Little shop group, because it was fun to build something that big and to work on it with some awesome people!
- Least Favorite: Laugh tracks. It was helpful for learning MVC and some basic routes, which was good, but I enjoyed using Rails more.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
- Perserverance. High-level concepts. In independant projects, you can't move forward without understanding and implementing a piece of functionality

What did you learn from your paired/group projects?
- How to communicate problems with others. How to split up a project into individual pieces. Project management. How to write code in a project where the thing you need may or may not exist yet. How to make comprimises. How to write things so they can be understood and used by others.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
- I joined/participated in a few possees. I reached out to mod 1 students to offer help.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
- Continue to participate in posses. Continue to offer help to lower mods. I regreted not participating in the NASA hack-a-thon.

What did you do with your posse over this module?
- Helped other memebers of the posse. Asked for help from other memebers. Spent time with a lot of people outside of school, both socially and academically.

What is your favorite thing about the posse experience?
- The awesome people I get to see and learn with everyday.

How has your posse expereince helped you grow as a professional?
- The people in the posse are what keeps me going. I'm excited everyday to wake up and come to school. I've gone to a few meetups with some people from my posse, and it's been fun sharing that experience with them.
