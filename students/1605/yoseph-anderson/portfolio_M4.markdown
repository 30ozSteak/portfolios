## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal this module was to learn more about javascript and be on my way to get a job.

### End of Module Assessment

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* **3: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5, and one supporting feature, with few bugs and no missing functionality.**

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style

* **3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Rails Style & API

* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style

* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 5. Testing

* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

### 6. User Interface

* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

### 7. Workflow

* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**

### Work

In module 4, the main focus is to improve on using javascript for client side programming.

> Yoseph -
on gametime, you were a champ. I really appreciated you letting me puzzle things out for myself sometimes, but not letting it get too far down the rabbit hole. your javascript ability is exceptional, but I would have liked to see you put more passion into it. I was, however, thankful that you expressed your feelings about wanting to focus on the job hunt. I can't really blame you for that. You've been studying JS since mod 1, so I know that the project was a different experience for you than it was for me. I was really appreciative of you pushing for us to build it out in ES6, it has helped my understanding of the differences between ES5 and ES6, although it was a source of frustration at the time. I know if we had had more time we could have figured out all the particulars of our game instead of just the MVP. Thanks for a great project!

## Professional Skills

### Gear Up Reflections

## GearUp 1

1. Have you ever been in a team setting where the differences between introverted and extroverted working styles was clear. What were the benefits and challenges of the styles?

The benefits were that we were able to see both ends of the spectrum, where many people were who were convinced of these convoluted ideas of having solely introverted and extroverted. The benefits that came out were that many people were able to excel in certain aspects as a team than they would have alone.


1. How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of introverts? How do you perceive the strengths and weaknesses of extroverts?

The strength’s of an “introvert” is that they are usually more in tune with themselves as well as are able to think things deeper in thought. The weakness obviously would be being able to talk to others, but I think there are mere ignorant labels. The strengths would be communication of an extrovert and ability to engage well with others. A weakness would be that they don’t know themselves as well since they are always out and seek attention.

1. How can you leverage the strengths of introverts and extroverts in your future projects and future career?

The easiest way to “leverage introvert and extroverts” is to put them in situations where they excel and would apply their knowledge to the team, or support a team’s weakness.


1. Do you think our current approaches to group activities at Turing are sufficiently accommodating to introverted personalities? Reflect on how we could reshape team and group activities (pairings, team retros, cohort retros) to create an environment in which introverts’ and extroverts strengths are equally supported.

No, I do not believe they are because the engagement at Turing at times (mainly Fridays) feels like a waste of time when people can be focusing on things that will make them further excel if they already have the skills. That, or there could be tracks that allow both introverts and extroverts to do what they would like.

### GearUp 2

* When you first read the title of this GearUp, what were your initial reactions? What experiences have you had that shaped your attitude toward the topic?

I have been going through a lot find find myself getting more and more resilient.

* What did you learn from reading the article? Did this change or affirm any attitudes and beliefs you hold?

I did not learn anything none did it change my attitudes.

* What value do you put on personal resilience? Why?

I believe it’s what determines a person’s future since they are in control of their own future.

* Consider Josh Spodek's premise that knowing about resilience is different than becoming more resilient. Identify 3 mental practices and behaviors that constitute resilience skills.

1. Looking at things from a positive perspective
2. Telling yourself that you can make it
3. Always trying to find a solution


### Description of your top 3 priorities in the job search and why

My three priorities are:

* Time to get job
* Salary
* Location

My priorities that I would like after reaching a stable point:

* Flexible time off
* Mentoring
* Salary

### Action plan for how to overcome perceived barriers to the job search

I plan on going out and being productive going to Meetups and networking.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I really enjoyed the whole Turing community and everything that they have offered. They have always been supportive since the very first day, and even though there have been stumbling block, I still believe in Turing's missions. I am happy with how the community have been to me and was glad to always contribute as much as I could.

### Being a Community Member

> Yoseph has been supporting me a lot and this module is no exception. He has a great calm way of explaining concepts and leading to the solution. I would find him in the basement and ask some questions about my projects and he would take his time to explain things. Even over the weekends, he was available on slack/phone to help me out. In addition, I have seen him a lot offering help to module 1 students. All in all, I think Yoseph is a valuable member of Turing community!

### Playing a Part

* Always looking for people to help if they look stuck
* Emotional support when working on big projects
* Help students when they message me on slack
