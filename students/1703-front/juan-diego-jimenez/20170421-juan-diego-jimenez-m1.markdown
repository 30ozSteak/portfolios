------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Exceptional:__ Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdiejim/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

* __Advanced Beginner:__  Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.
* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
* __Exceptional__ You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.

#### Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Conditional Logic

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.

#### Style

* __Proficient:__ Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

#### Feedback
Juan was a pleasure to work with and a great project partner. His strength in JavaScript helped build a strong foundation for our project right out of the gate, and we were able to build on top of it together from there. His code is very well organized and includes really usefull comments. Staying in communication was never an issue and for the few project features that we divyed up between ourselves, Juan met and exceeded expectations! In the future, my only suggestion to Juan would be to wait until he’s had a chance to meet and speak with his partner before starting to write code for the project. At the very begining of the project, this left me needing to catch up a little bit to what he had completed already, however Juan did a great job of explaining to me what his code did and his thought process behind it.

#### Feedback
Bottom line up front, I thought our partnership was successful.  We accomplished our goal of completing the base project, and also stayed on top of Git & GitHub, like you'd set the goal for us to do.  As a teammate, I appreciated that you were willing to share your opinions and lead our team.  Although it's clear you have a stronger understanding of the JavaScript concepts and can work through them much faster than I can, I appreciated that you sat down with me for Driver-Navigator to allow me to work through some of the problems we were assigned.  At times, however, the functionality you wrote independently would have been beneficial for me to work alongside you on.  In future projects, I would recommend staying true to the projects tasks as the team has assigned them so you're not getting too far ahead of the agreed-upon task order.  If you know you'll have more time, request more tasks, then the advantage to the team is that those additional tasks can be chosen strategically, where your partner is comfortable being less involved.  Thank you for a great project.  I learned a lot and enjoyed working with you.
