# Lindsay Parker - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
_What did you set out to accomplish this module?_

My goals for this module were to (1) pass it, (2) still enjoy the problem-solving and coding aspects by the end of it, and (3) to work hard and not feel like I left anything behind.  At this point, I feel as though I've accomplished what I set out to in this module.

_feedback to me_

"I learned a lot about time management and organization and realistic expectations from you. AND GITHUB dâ€™oh. Your problem-solving skills are top notch. We had a good balance of driver-navigating and remote coding, that was cool. We also had a good balance of working on all three files, so I got well-balanced practice even though I am not so equally skilled at all three. You supported me in where I was at and helped me push myself. You also gave me space to practice commands and get better at that while we worked together. Our schedules and communication styles worked well together. Having a good bit of the comp done when we started was a helpful surprise, but if I could do it over again, starting together from scratch might have made it feel more equally ours."

_feedback to me_

"Lindsay was a pleasure to work with. She is a natural leader, and her ideas improved the productivity and functionality of the project. I admire her project management skills, which helped build the structure of our project, and made the workflow feel more efficient and smooth. She has a very great eye for detail, and fixed a lot of bugs in our JavaScript file that improved the functionality of our project. I appreciate her consistency in maintaining a firm process of pushing branches. It improved the organization and balance of our contributions in GitHub, and prevented potential errors of overriding files in our master branch. This is a great practice, which I will strongly implement in my future projects. Regarding coaching feedback for my partner and opportunities to improve, in her next project, she could consider being more vocal with her partner if there are some concepts that need more explanation. I tend to go fast as navigator when writing JavaScript code, and I always like to check with my partner if my explanations and though process is clear, or if I am going too fast. In some occasions, I wasn't always sure if she was understanding my ideas. However, by the end of the project, we both completely knew our code from top to bottom, and were able to explain its functionality. Overall, I am glad she was my partner. I learned a lot from her way of working, and I will apply her project management style in my future projects."
