# Emily Kuckelman - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to fully understand the content that was taught. The first time around I felt like I was scrambling to just try and keep up and barely kept my head above the water the entire time. This time around I spent more time outside of class, and on the weekend to work on projects and got to phase 4 on every paired project except the last one.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pretty positive that I passed!


## B: Individual Work & Projects
 * Throughout mod 1 we had 1 personal javascript project and then 3 static composition projects. Number guesser was the first project of the entire mod, and the first time to combine html, css, and javascript to make an application. THe static comps were projects that were meant to make us get stronger in our CSS and HTML skills. WE were given a picture of a comp and told to recreate it. We were allowed to be creative with color and theme, but had to stick to the comp as best as we could.

#### Evaluation comments
##### Evaluator: 
    *Louisa
##### Notes/What To Work On:
  * A little bit of UI spacing adjustment to really match the comp
  * missing user feedback for when you win after changing min and max
  * CSS is SO MUCH BETTER!!! Really well done!!!
  * So much progress!

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
These projects were given to us to help us work on our Javascript skills and use the information gained from the lessons, and implement them into working applications. I aimed to get to phase 4 of each project, and did so except for the last project. These projects made us use html and css to re-create the comp that is given in every project description.

#### (Linked-List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ekuckelman/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

* This project was our first paired project and our first time appending a card full of elements to the page when a submit button is clicked. This project requried a lot more planning and thinking. We had to make sure the inputs had valid content in them. Made buttons that were appended run different functions, and learned how to use jQuery.

##### Notes/What To Work On:

###### OVERVIEW
* All the way through Phase 4!!! You both did great with speaking to your code.
###### DESIGN
* Stays true to the spirit of the comp
* Like the color choices for the counter
* Add spacing between borders and cards. Make sure that the 'Linked List' header is flush with inputs/buttons
* Some work to make it fully responsive - weirdness happening before different media queries
* Ditch the alert for error messaging and find a more elegant solution. Tell the user to know that part of having a valid URL includes having http:// tacked on the front
* Bookmark box falling outside of parent container
###### HTML
  * Good spacing. Keep using semantic tags.
  * Lines 3-39 should be indented two more spaces. Lines 7 & 8 should be one line. Use HTML Style Guide for reference
  * Add aria-labels to inputs and send through screen reader
  * Inputs should have a form around them for accessibility w/keyboard. This allows you to submit with a keypress (as it's currently set up, it only submits on click)
###### CSS
  * Nice job with organizing declarations alphabetically in each selector
  * No need for a 0 margin on body since you are using a reset
  * Overuse of absolute positioning. Typically, you want to use absolute ONLY when you can't get any other positioning to make the layout work
  * Add box-sizing: border-box to override default box-sizing to make sure boxes are the exact width you set.

###### JS
  * Nice job using named functions in event listeners
  * Unclear why event listener is set up on body instead of the link counter div in Line 6
  * Like the focus back to the input on 15 and 22
  * Check for using soft wrap on long lines of code
  * Nice job knowing what this is in your code!! As well as being able to speak to your regex code!
  * Opportunity for some refactoring in event listener for creating card - but good overall!
