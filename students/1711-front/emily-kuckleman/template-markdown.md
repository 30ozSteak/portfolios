# Emily Kuckelman - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to fully understand the content that was taught. The first time around I felt like I was scrambling to just try and keep up and barely kept my head above the water the entire time. This time around I spent more time outside of class, and on the weekend to work on projects and got to phase 4 on every paired project except the last one.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pretty positive that I passed!


## B: Individual Work & Projects
 * Throughout mod 1 we had 1 personal javascript project and then 3 static composition projects. Number guesser was the first project of the entire mod, and the first time to combine html, css, and javascript to make an application. THe static comps were projects that were meant to make us get stronger in our CSS and HTML skills. WE were given a picture of a comp and told to recreate it. We were allowed to be creative with color and theme, but had to stick to the comp as best as we could.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects
These projects were given to us to help us work on our Javascript skills and use the information gained from the lessons, and implement them into working applications. I aimed to get to phase 4 of each project, and did so except for the last project. These projects made us use html and css to re-create the comp that is given in every project description.

* This project was our first paired project and our first time appending a card full of elements to the page when a submit button is clicked. This project requried a lot more planning and thinking. We had to make sure the inputs had valid content in them. Made buttons that were appended run different functions, and learned how to use jQuery.
