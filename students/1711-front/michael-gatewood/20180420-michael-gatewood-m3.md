# Michael Gatewood - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal in M3 is to become more knowledgeable in React, Redux, and fetching data from APIs.  While Weatherly in Mod2 was a nice introduction, I would like to get in enough repetitions to where I am able to implement React and Redux without thinking about it.  I would like to better understand promises and how they relate to fetching data from APIs.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 

## Bar Builder

### Completion

* 4- - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

### CSS/Design

* 3+ - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Code Quality

* 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Redux Architecture

* 3 - All state changes are handled by Redux with exeception to Controlled Forms. Actions and Reducers are simple. Containers don’t hold unnecessary data.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### PropType Implementation

* Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### README Updates

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and running

### Testing

* 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

### Workflow

* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren’t reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 

## swAPI Box

### Specification Adherence

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Code Quality

* 2.5 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app but did not use them as intended. Significant refactoring necessary.

### CSS/Design

* 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes. Follows majority of the 10 Essential Usability Guidelines.

### Testing

* 2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

### PropType Implementation

* Fail - There are components missing proptype validation.

### README Updates

* Pass - The README.md file has been updated with a description of the project, the team, and how to get it up and
  running 

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints

### Workflow

* 3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

* **C: Group Work & Projects**:

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 4 - The application completes all 2 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Code Quality

* 3+ - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Workflow

* 4 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that clearly document the evolution of the application and do not contain irrelevant changesets that aren't reflected by the commit message. Commit messages are concise and consistent in syntax and tense. Developer(s) effectively use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing directly to master. There are no instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There are no instances of "dead" or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log.

* **D: Professional Skills**:

My first Gear-Up session was on an idea known as GroupThink.  GroupThink is the tendency for members in a given group to gradually drift toward the same beliefs and styles of thinking. It can be harmful to your team effectiveness, to your products, and ultimately to the individuals on your team.  We reviewed what it is, reviewed examples, and discussed ideas on how to mitigate it.

My second Gear-Up session was a discussion and practical exercise on mindfulness.  Mindfulness can mean different things to different people.  To me, it is focusing all of our attention to our body and senses in order to bring us back to the present.  We discussed different ways to use mindfulness to reduce stress and practiced several stretching techniques.

* **E: Community Participation**: I attended Wrap-Ups and community events such as demos and SAV events.  I was also an active participant in all retros.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Mod 3 projects were heavily focused on React and fetch calls.  Other concepts such as Router, Redux, postgreSQL, and middleware were also introduced and applied throughout the module.
