# MICHAEL GATEWOOD - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal in M2 was to become familiar with the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming and improve my ability to solve complex problems using algorithmic thinking.

## A: Individual Work & Projects

_Reflect on your individual work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

My individual projects challenged my ability to break complex problems into smaller, manageable, achieveable goals.  Test-driven development was further introduced in individual projects.  Finally, I was able to make great strides in my ability and willingness to solict ideas, assistance, and suggestions from others.  Even with the help of others, these projects were very challenging and I doubt I would have had the same level of success without their help.  I fully intend to continue use the human resources available throughout Turing when I am presented with a challenge I cannot solve on my own.  If I am to change any behavior in the next mod, it wil likely be that I ask for help sooner.

### Study Habits

_What did you notice changed in your study habits from the previous inning to this one? What stayed the same? Do your study habits serve you well?_

I spent more time this inning studying and working through problems with others.  While in terms of execution, I work better alone; I am finding that learning from others' knowledge and experience is an invaluable process that cannot be ignored.  Because I was so challenged with these projects, I found it more difficult to read-ahead.  This negatively impacted my learning and created a cycle where I felt like I was constantly playing catch-up.  In M3, I will place this priority above all others.

### Sorting Suite
* **Outcome:** _Pass/Fail_

_What did you enjoy about Sorting Suite? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

My goal in completing the Sorting Suite project was to develop sorting programs using the principles of bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort and merge sort. While I enjoyed the challenge overall, the lack of incremental wins created a lot of stress and struggle.  In comparison, Game Time was a matter of implenting a feature and moving on to the next.  For Sorting Suit, I felt like that I didn't fully grasp everything that every algorithm was doing until the morning of the evaluation.  Had the evaluation been only a few hours sooner, I would not have been comfortable writing the code.  However, I think the struggle provided me with a better overall understanding of the concepts and I am grateful to be able to take this knowledge with me into an interview and explain each methodolgy with confidence.

### Complete Me

* **Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** _0 - 4_
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_
* **Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Complete Me? What was challenging? How did working together on Sorting Suite compare to your work for GameTime? for Weathrly? How does this project serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Complete Me was another challenging project that my cohort more-or-less treated like a class project.  This was the moment where the cohort came together as a team and leaned on each other to get through the project.  Without the teamwork of the entire class, the struggle would be magnified exponentially.  Even with the support of classmates, however, this was a project that never truly came together until the end, much like Sorting Suite.  What I take with me from this project is comradere with my cohort, another step towards a succesful interview, and a tool to use in my Weathrly project (and more?).

## B: Group Work & Projects

_Reflect on your group work and projects throughout the inning. Did they help you with your areas of emphasis (from above)? What was the most challenging? What patterns do you plan to continue for the next inning? What do you plan to change?_

My group projects allowed me to diversify my techniques in working with other people with varying work styles and varying expertise.  Both projects were exercises in give and take.

### GameTime
* **Partner:** _Partner's Name_
* **Game:** _Name of game you built_
* **Functional Expectations:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **Testing/Code Sanitation:** _0 - 4_
* **JS Style:** _0 - 4_
* **Workflow:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about GameTime? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

Working with canvas was my favorite part of Game Time.  I enjoyed the process of putting together canvas objects on the screen...one dot at a time...then refactoring the construction of those objects with loops.  Animating the screen was a lot of fun as well.  I had to make a lot of compromises in my pairing and my patience was tested repeatedly (not because of my partner, but because of my preferred work style).  I came out of this pairing a better partner than I was going in.

### Weathrly
* **Partner:** _Partner's Name_
* **Spec Adherence:** _0 - 4_
* **User Interface:** _0 - 4_
* **HTML Style:** _0 - 4_
* **CSS/Sass Style:** _0 - 4_
* **JS/React Style:** _0 - 4_

_What did you enjoy about Weathrly? What was challenging? What skills did you learn that serve your Areas of Emphasis (from above)? How does it serve your overall goals at Turing and beyond?_

My favorite part of Weathrly was becoming familiar with React and learning to work with data from an API.  I had a great partner and we struggled a lot!  However, we communicated effectively and worked extremely hard to put together a viable product.  This was by far the most practical application I had developed to-date.  The most challenging part of Weathrly for me was working with Complete Me and writing tests.  Incoporating Complete Me was frustrating because as a stand-alone app, it "just worked."  Writing tests was challenging because we were no longer testing data.  Validating that x equals y is much easier than verifying that something is rendered, mocking functions, and simulating user interaction.  I feel much stronger in testing than I did coming into M2, but I feel that I still have a long way to go in this respect toward becoming a productive developer.

## C: Professional Skills

* **PD Sessions:**
  * _List here_

_What did you learn during the PD sessions that was surprising? What skills did you hone? Do you feel better prepared for your future professional life as a developer?_

* **Gear Up Sessions:**
  * _List here_

_What did you learn during the Gear Up sessions that was surprising? Do you find it important to have conversations like the ones in the Gear Up Sessions? Do you feel like you have the tools to keep having these conversations in the future? in your workplace? with your teammates?_

## Community Participation

_Reflect on your community participation this inning. How did you opt-in to the community here at Turing? in Denver? Did you pair with students in other modules? Was the experience enjoyable? Illuminating?_

## Final Assessment

_What skills from this inning do you plan to review/strengthen over intermission weeek? What are you looking forward to about next inning? What are you going to do over intermission week to recharge your batteries and reconnect with your longterm goals?_
