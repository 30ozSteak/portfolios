## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

I set out to really understand how React works. I thought I had a handle on it last time but the improvements I feel I made has shown me how wrong I was. I finally feel ready to consider myself a programmer.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

Passed
## B: Individual Work & Projects

(This mod’s individual projects included SWAPI Box and my personal project, League Leader. I became more comfortable with React and Redux in the process. These projects helped me nail down testing in React and Redux as well as ganging a better understanding of the React landscape in general.  )

#### (SWAPI BOX)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abomb14c/swapi-box-2)
* [Original Assignment](1.Get comfortable whipping together React components on your own with the additional complexity of implementing React Router (if you want to).
1. Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
2. Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
3. Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
4. Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
5. Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
6. Use propTypes for every component receiving props)

(SWAPI-box is a react app that allows users to view Star Wars data from the Star Wars API https://swapi.co/documentation. There are four buttons that allow the user to browse through people, planets, vehicles and favorites. Users can add cards to favorites by clicking on the favorite button.)

#### (League Leader)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/abomb14c/league-leader)
* [Original Assignment]( The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will solve an actual problem.)

(League-Leader is an app designed to make betting with friends much easier to do. Users have the ability to log in, pick a sport and draft teams. Users will soon have the ability to invite other users and hold multi-person live drafts. The App is built with React, Redux, and Router on the frontend and node, express, and knex on the backend.)

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Group projects for this mod included HeadCount 2.0 and MovieTracker. I feel that this time around I really focused on teaching the processes of React and Redux to confirm my own understanding. I feel as if I gained a much better understanding of both and got a lot of joy out of helping others understand it. )

#### (HeadCount 2.0)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/quinhill/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment]( 	•	Separate application logic into small, testable functions.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
)

(Head-count is an app designed to display kindergarten data from the Colorado public education system. Functionality includes the ability to search for a school's data, and the ability to compare a school against another school. The main goal of this project was to become more comfortable with React components, passing props, and TDD.

### (MovieTracker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/gavin-love/movieTracker)
* [Original Assignment]( The goal of this project was to use and understand redux in conjunction with React. We learned to pass props, connect the redux store to the visual layer, and most importantly, how to test redux. )

(Movie-Tracker is an app designed to display data using the moviedb API. It has functionality allowing users to view upcoming movies, their description and their overall rating. Users are also able to select favorites from from the list of movies and view them later under the favorites button. The main goal of this project was to learn about how to use redux, router, TDD as well as gain a better understanding of react.)

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(I did my best to be  helpful to students going through lower mods and to my classmates going through mod3 for the first time. I feel as if I became a better teacher in the process. It was fun and something I enjoyed more than I thought I would. )
