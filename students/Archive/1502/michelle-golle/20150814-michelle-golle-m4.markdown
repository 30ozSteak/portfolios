# Michelle Golle - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on JavaScript. After our classes this module along with many Egghead videos/tutorials I feel much more confident.

### End of Module Assessment

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellegolle/task_manager)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/f477463136d8a4d954ea)

* Features: 4
* UI: 4-
* Testing: 4-
* Rails Style: 3+
* Ruby Style: 3
* JavaScript Style: 3

* Nice use of the bootstrap form gem!
* Generally pleasant transitions, esp on the filtering
* Some better solution for the resetting to the default list when applying filters/tags (idk what it is)
* Nice use of shoulda matchers
* Reasonable tests
* Generally good feature tests, but consolidate a bit more
 (they're expensive and tedious, so mostly their purpose is to verify wiring)
* Nice use of scopes to keep high-level concerns elegant and declarative
* (javascript) Looks good!
* Some opportunity for refactoring (ie common structure within the filters)

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of a 1/2 day
absence on Friday, July 24th.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Revenge of Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellegolle/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/4fdd6da8e2e431beeb77012e271de1eee90d5e07/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

In this 4-day-long project I built an idea box that used jquery and JavaScript to
add, update, and delete ideas without refreshing the whole page. It was evaluated by Tess:

"I loved how organized the JS is based on what we've learned so far."
"Maybe just try to work on some additional features."

* Features: 2.5
* UI: 3
* Testing: 3
* Rails Style: 4
* Ruby Style: 4
* JavaScript Style: 3

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellegolle/scale-up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

In this seven-day project I took a pivoted project, added a large amount of seed data to the data base, and improved its performace. It was evaluated by Horace with the following results:

"Good improvements based on a small amount of changes so far, would love to see how much better it can get with some caching etc"

* Deployed to Heroku: Y
* Uses Newrelic: Y
* What is the average performance and traffic? 2
* Required number of records seeded? Y
* Load Testing Script 2
* Performance Optimization Techniques 2
* Additional Features 3


## Team

### Projects
I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time: Duck Hunt

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellegolle/duck-hunt)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this 7-day-long project We built a recreation of the classic duck hunt game. This was a pure JavaScript project. It was evaluated by Jeff:

"Game is decently playable. Some unpredictability of the speed unless you refresh.
You can shoot ducks
Used Canvas for moving the duck around
15 tests that all pass
Decided to improve code rather than build more features
JS implementation looks pretty clean
Look for opportunities to push functionality out of your "god object" into the children -- out from index.js into other files."

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 3
Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
Fundamental JS and Style: 3
Code Sanitation: 4

#### Mastery Project: Cowboy Kyle's Trading Post

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mihir787/tradingPost)

* Feature completion: 1
* Organization: 4
* UX: 3
* Performance: 3
* Testing: 2.5
* Code quality: 3

### Feedback to Me

Feedback from both peers and staff encouraged me to speak up more often and be sure to make my ideas heard. This module I incorporated that feedback and made an effort to do so in group projects, class and during retros.

"It's been really great getting to work with you and getting to know you better during the last two modules,  Michelle! You always bring a nice energy to our group and you've been a real pleasure to work with!" - Fred

"We've gotten to work on two projects together and both times went pretty smoothly. In your portfolio you mention how you've gotten feedback to speak up more and I would agree with that, but I think you're doing awesome at it. Whenever I was stumped in our Game Time project, you seemed to always be able to chime in and help get us going in the right direction, so I would say to just embrace that and do try to speak up more because I think you do have some really valuable ideas." - Tom

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I have provided feedback to four of my classmates on their portfolio pull requests as comments.

### Playing a Part

* During week 1 I completed clean up duty with my posse.
* On July 12th, I wrote a piece about myself for the featured student portion of the Posse Post
* On Friday, July 17th, I delivered a lightning talk "Susan Cain: The Quiet Revolution"
* During week six I brought in k-cups for the Keurig to help fuel our last week.
