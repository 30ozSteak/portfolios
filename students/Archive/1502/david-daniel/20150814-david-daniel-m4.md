## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Upon entering module 4, I decided to focus my attention on on polishing my front-end skills, particularly raw javascript. 

### End of Module Assessment

Passed with all 3's, after fixing a validation bug and beefing up test coverage (I had integration tests, but didn't have all of the CRUD functionality tested)

### Attendance

Missed 3 days the week of 8/3 due to illness (survived west nile, maybe). Intermittently missed class due to interviews, but I tried my best to schedule around class-time.

### Work
  

#### Scrabble-Sockets / Mastery Project


* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/haveanicedavid/socket-scrabble)

Notes: ambitious project spec
* Intended to make a websocket game using canvas
* got sick during the project; lost time to that and to job interview assignments
* Main issue seems to be inability to complete functioning small iteration before tackling additional problems.

* Ended up partially attacking a lot of fairly difficult portions (game logic, infinite boards, websocket/real-time updating, drag and drop, canvas rendering, etc). Would have been better to focus on smaller portions and get them done.

* Additionally might have helped to focus on completing the bigger picture without as many details (e.g., get some crude version of the game working but without implementing all scrabble rules and restrictions.)

#### Scaleup

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/haveanicedavid/scaleup)

Got things up on Heroku and data
Pagination in place
Load script not quite working
One use of caching

Scores: 
Average Response: 2, no horrifying
Load Testing: 1, not working correctly
Database Load: Y, good data
Performance: 1, ready to attack but not there
Additional Feature: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I made effort to contribute what I felt was valuable feedback, both to individual students and Turing.

### Playing a Part

* Organized a weekend game of Ultimate frisbee
* Led a 2-hour student-session on optimization tools for workflow
* Wrote a blog post on the editor war, and why it's silly
* Helped numerous module 1-3 folks with various projects, mainly JS-related
* Replied to several Reddit threads about Turing, sharing my experience and encouraging others
