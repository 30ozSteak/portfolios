### Areas of Emphasis

I focused a lot on technical interview prep this module.  When Jeff presented us with the job challenge prior to starting module 4, I made it a point to focus on building my professional image and prepping for a variety of data structure/algorithm/computer science based questions that are often asked in interviews. I have started to learn some Java and worked through Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Lackman which is written in Java.  My thought process is that if I am fortunate enough to get a technical interview, I do not want to squander the opportunity because I do not how to build a HashSet or correctly implement a queue.  As a result of the time and vigor I have put into it, I have done fairly well with technical interviews.  

My second area of emphasis was getting some exposure with JS.  I found that I really enjoy writing Object Oriented JS.  I wanted to jump into JS the same way we jumped into ruby in module 1,  learn the core language and then jump into frameworks.


### End of Module Assessment

The JQuery was the tough part of this assessment for me.  I felt that I was running low on time for a lot of the JS/JQ stuff so I really had to rush through it.  However, I do feel very proud of the rails backend. I got strait 3s and one 2 because I was not able to implement a second additional feature.  
### Attendance

This module I attended all classes unless I was out for interviews, which have been on August 7th and July 31st.

### Work

#### Scale-Up
Scale up was an individual project that focused on learning and experimenting with performance measuring tools and enhancement techniques. My attempt at this slightly crashed and burned.  The first few days of the project were spent solely on configuration and seeding the database for the project.  However, I did learn a lot about memcache and id'ing slow areas.

Some 1s(my load script broke) And A Few 2s, And one 3
Jeff evaluated me on this project.

#### IdeaBox 2.0
Redo idea box in JavaScript. This honestly was one of my favorite assignments.  I learned a lot about writing JavaScript and using AJAX. I could have been more complete with testing. Over the course of the module we went over JS testing and I feel better about it.

Feat: 3, UI: 2.7, Testing:1.5, Rails Style: 3.5, Ruby Style: 3.5, JS style: 3

### Projects
#### Game Time: BreakOut

I built this game with Kyle Henson.  It was the first time Kyle and I worked together and we had a really solid group dynamic. This project was challenging because of all the math that was involved.  I was definitely doing some y=mx + b stuff. We got the whole project finished at we did TDD all the way through.  We did get stuck however when were encorporating the canvas, which caused a lot of our other tests to break(which is a sign of too many dependencies). For me this is the project that I am most proud of in module 4.  We solved a mathematically challenging problem in JS.

#### Mastery Project: tradingPost


An internal trading tool for Turing students (like Craiglist).  We used Angular as our client-side framework while using a Rails backend.  This project was very challenging because we were learning Angular and didn't have mentor who knew enough Angular to help us when we got stuck.  However, this project kicked-off my adventure into the world of Angular. I will be building my second Angular app in less than week and hopefully the growing pains from this project have some value.

We were evaluated by Steve. Our scores were 4, 3.5 3, 2, 4.

## Community
In module 1 I played no role in the Turing Community.  I came to school everyday, worked hard, coded my butt off, and went home. I did the same thing for 6 weeks.  At the start of module 2 I made an effort to become more integrated into the Turing community.  It all started with being more involved with my cohort.  My cohort is the reason I am more involved in the general community.  They helped me realize that I can work hard and still be involved in other peoples lives.  In modules 3 and 4 I served as our cohorts Student Advisory Board rep.  The community is now what drives and motivates me. I was not at the least bit nervous when I was doing my Denver.rb talk because if knew there were a good number of Turing peoples supporting me.  That support is awesome.  
I give the Turing community a 9/10 (nice job community!)

### Giving Feedback
This is something I am not so good at and unfortunately I am recognizing it now as I do my portfolio. Sometimes I let things go for a little too long and become distant.  I need to figure out a way to provide people constructive criticism while also providing strong support.  
I give myself 5/10

### Playing a Part

Though I may not be strongest at giving feedback, I do feel that I play a sizeable role at Turing. When Todd Resudek from MasteryConnect came to visit. I played the role as tour guide/host.  The following day I followed up with him at Boulder.rb. A week later they all of sudden want to hire a number of junior developers.  I still keep in contact with Todd and I want to make sure that Turing has a strong relationship with MasteryConnect.

I also recently have been help students in module 3 with resume related tasks.  

I spoke at Denver.rb this week (8/11/2015)

I had lunch with a then-perspective Turing student who is coming into the upcoming module.

I wrote a blog post on queues (7/27/2015)

Participated in Student Advisory Board

Overall participation score for myself 9/10
