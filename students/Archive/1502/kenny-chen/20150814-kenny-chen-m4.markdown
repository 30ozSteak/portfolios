## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I focused a lot on Javascript this module and the end of the last. I'm comfortable with testing Javascript now, though I still need some work. I feel competent with JavaScript at this point, but I still get stumped sometimes. I think this is how my relationship with JavaScript will always be, but I'm excited to start building some new things.

Personally the goals of this module was continuing to improve my rails knowledge  and increase my familiarity with JavaScript and some front in frame work. All of these objections were all met. JavaScript is not as scary as before but I am still a bit out from being as comfortable in it as Ruby.


### End of Module Assessment

This was a intense assessment. At first it didn't seem so daunting and definitely doable but as the day went on and the list of things to do went down slower than anyone imagined. At the end it was great to put it together in one day but it was not very polished. I recieved all 3s.


### Attendance

I attended everyday of every module.

### Work


Scale up was an individual project focusued on performance techniques based on measurements. Overall it was a fun project to try out different things and learn about it. There were some flaws in the project as it was a real pain to get the project up in running before we can start messing around with it. Particularly the seed data and moving the database to heroku.

## Team

### Projects

Tetris is our Gametime project. The group was Kristina, Andrew and myself. We purposely choose a more difficult project and had lots of fun doing it and learned a great deal of Javascript in the process. We did fall short of completion though.

#### Game Time: Tetris

* github.com/carmer/tetris

We created a disco theme to go with our tetris.

The project was tons of fun, we test drove it and learned a great deal.

We got all 3's on this project by Jeff.


#### Mastery Project: IPAPI 

* github.com/boomkenster/IPAPA-ember
* github.com/tleskin/IPAPI-rails

The main goal of this project was to get some exposure to ember. It proved much larger to learn and we only were able to get a taste of it. Nonetheless we did learn about it and were satisfied with what we did.

We were evaluated by Steve. Our scores were 2, 3, 3, 2, 4

### Feedback to Me

In the previous module feedback from my peers, they have all been complimentary of my mood and postive attitude. I have not received negative feedback yet but I continue to  

## Community
The community is one of the best things about Turing. I will continue to be part of it on our New York branch along with many others who are already there. I intend to speak at some meetups or conferences at some point in the future.

### Giving Feedback
In groups and when I see people slipping. I tend to give them honest constuctive feedback which they know is coming with good intentions. I try to also be also in surveys and retros as well as encourage others to do so.

I've given feedback to several students.

### Playing a Part

I like to keep things lighthearted and fun. Everyone has things going on but school/work should be seperate and I prefer to have fun while I work hard. I try to learn everyone's name and make them feel welcomed.

On Sunday July 26 and August 9 I helped students with debug and guide in the right direction.
