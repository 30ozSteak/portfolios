## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt not great with JavaScript. Now that we are at the end I not
only feel better about JavaScript, but much more comfortable with jQuery, and node, and websockets. Basically I learned more than I could have known I wanted to learn this module. 

### End of Module Assessment

rails
* GitHub: https://github.com/kristinabrown/final-assessment
* Production: https://id-rather-be-somewhere-else.herokuapp.com

node
* GitHub: https://github.com/kristinabrown/final-assessment-node
* Production: https://cryptic-scrubland-3747.herokuapp.com

In this 24 hour sprint I made a one-page task management app that can hold many lists, with many tasks, all of which can be created, edited, and deleted, and all without page refreshes. It has WebSocket integration so you can have many tabs open that keep up with what you're doing. And it also sends an email to a friend you cc. Josh Cheek was the evaluator: 

"The websockets make it really exciting."

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an
absence on Thursday, July 23rd and Friday, July 24th.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Revenge of Idea Box

* https://github.com/kristinabrown/idea-box
* https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/4fdd6da8e2e431beeb77012e271de1eee90d5e07/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown

In this 4-day-long project I built an idea box that used jquery and JavaScript to 
add, update, and delete ideas without refreshing the whole page. It was evaluated by Patrick:

"Logic in the idea model, testing is really really good."

* Features: 3
* UI: 3.5
* Testing: 4
* Rails Style: 3.5
* Ruby Style: 4
* JavaScript Style: 3

#### Scale Up

* https://github.com/kristinabrown/scale-up
* https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown

In this seven-day project I took a pivoted project, added a million rows in the data base, and improved its performace. It was evaluated by Steve with the following results:

"I mean, it seems like you know what you're doing."

* Deployed to Heroku: Y
* Uses Newrelic: Y
* What is the average performance and traffic? 3
* Required number of records seeded? Y
* Load Testing Script 4
* Performance Optimization Techniques 4
* Additional Features 3


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time: Disco Tetris

* https://github.com/kristinabrown/tetris
*  https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown

In this 7-day-long project we built a mostly functional disco tetris game. This was a pure JavaScript project. It was evaluated by Jeff:

"I think your game gave me a headache."

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
* Fundamental JS and Style: 3
* Code Sanitation: 3

##### My Contribution
We didn't really split up the responsibilities in this project. The three of us paired most of the time because it was all pretty new to all of us.

##### Takeaway
* Object oriented programing is really, really important.
* If you recognize a problem early on you should just fix it because it'll get exponentially worse as you go on.

#### Final Project: Turing Scavenger Hunt

* https://github.com/eric-dowty/scavenger-hunt

In this 2 week project we built the Turing Scavenger Hunt app. It's a real time rails app that uses Redis and Node to send immediate updates. It was evaluated by Jorge:

"I wish there was another section on 'technical challenge', I would give you a 4 on that."

* Completion: 4 
* Organization: 3.5 
* Test-Driven Development: 3 
* Code Quality: 2 
* User Experience: 3
* Performance: 4 

##### My Contribution
We did extensive planning on the project all together. I set up the submission model, hooked that up to AWS. I was also in charge of setting up the views, and doing the mobile first design. I helped get the web sockets working and was in charge of getting them working on Heroku.

##### Takeaway
* Planning something well makes a huge difference with collaboration and workflow (things went pretty smoothly).
* Websockets are great and not that hard. 

### Feedback to Me

People liked me last module and I think they still do.

The Feedback I got from Eric:
Feedback for you: I think this last project was the only one we got to work on together, which is really too bad because I really liked working with you. You're drive and ability to figure things out is truly impressive! My personality thrives when I'm around people that challenge me and you definitely do that, so thank you very much. You also take the time to get to know your team mates and take care of the community around you in a genuine way, which I think will serve you well in the future. Now the BAD!!!! No bullshit, I do not have a lot here.  I've heard feedback that you work at a pace that can be intimidating to others. This is the strangest negative feedback ever because I personally don't see anything wrong with it, that is just some feedback I got from someone else in our cohort (ask me in private if you want to know more).

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave honest feedback to everyone who asked for it.
