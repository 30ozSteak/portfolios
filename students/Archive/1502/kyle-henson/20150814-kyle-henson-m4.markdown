# Kyle Henson - Module4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, my goal was to focus on Javascript, jQuery, and a Front End Framework. I think I have found a deep interest in Front End development and wanted to make sure that I felt confident in pursuing a Front End job. I also really wanted to focus on writing Object-Oriented Javascript.

### End of Module Assessment

For the final assessment we were tasked with building a task management application in 24 hours. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete lists; create and edit tasks associated with a list, as well as update and filter lists without refreshing the page.

*Features: 2
*User Interface: 3

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of a half-day absence on July 23 and July 31 for interviews.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Revenge of Idea Box

*https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/4fdd6da8e2e431beeb77012e271de1eee90d5e07/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown

In this 4-day-long project I built an idea box that used jQuery and JavaScript to create, update, and delete ideas without refreshing the whole page. I was evaluated by Minnie:

"It's beautiful!"

*Features: 3
*UI: 3.5
*Testing: 2
*Rails Style: 4
*Ruby Style: 4
*JavaScript Style: 2.5

#### Scale Up

*https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown

This week-long project had me taking a existing code base and improving the performance and load. It focused on handling a database with large numbers of records, heavy traffic, and fixing bottlenecks.

*Deployed to Heroku: Y
*Uses Newrelic: Y
*What is the average performance and traffic? 3
*Required number of records seeded? Y
*Load Testing Script 2
*Performance Optimization Techniques 2
*Additional Features 3

## Team

### Projects

I had the opportunity to work on the following projects this module:

#### Game Time: Break Out

* https://github.com/mihir787/breakOut
* https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown

This week-long project had us build out a functional game in vanilla Javascript in an Object-Oriented style. Break Out posed a special challenge, as it was math heavy, but my partner and I were able to polish up those skills.

"Tight coupling of presentation and business logic"

*Functional Expectations: 3
*Test-Driven Development: 2
*Breaking Logic Into Components: 2
*Fundamental JS and Style: 3
*Code Sanitation: 2

##### Feedback

Create an object that takes care of drawing for the game to truly complete the OO portion. That way, all units can be tested thoroughly.

#### Final Project: Cowboy Kyle's Trading Post

* https://github.com/mihir787/tradingPost

Craigslist is extremely popular, but not for their UI/UX. In this 2 week project, we set out to rebuild Craigslist with an attractive UI/UX. We focused on building out an API with Rails and having an Angular front-end that would make calls to the API and render the data.


*Completion: 1
*Organization: 4
*Test-Driven Development: 2.5
*Code Quality: 3
*User Experience: 3
*Performance: 3

### Feedback

*I've watched your growth since Module 1 and I am very impressed with your growth as a developer. Sure every once in a while we are challenged with new content, syntax and overwhelming assignments. But each day we absorb a little more knowledge and gain a better understanding of how all these pieces fit together. - Lori
*Kyle! Sales Engine dream team. Seriously though, Sales Engine was hectic but we kept such a good schedule and really knocked that thing out. Great pairing partner and you've come so far since module 1. It's great to see. - Patrick

## Community

### Playing a Part

* Played a part in the supportive social role at Turing. When I noticed that individuals looked troubled, I would approach them/ make myself available.
* Participated in charity events and played the role of Turing ambassador at those events.
* Meet with two potential Turing students personally to answer questions and give advice on being a student at Turing.
* Helped with overall cleanliness of the dungeon on a regular basis.
