Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to sharpen my JavaScript skills. I came into the programming only knowing JavaScript and Ruby quickly replaced it as the language I could manipulate better. I wanted to understand closures, the server-side of JavaScript and be able to solve problems with it the same way that I can solve problems using Ruby.

End of Module Assessment
I created a TasK Manager with the additional filtering and tags extensions. Horace was my evaluator and thought that code on both the JavaScript and Ruby side was made to be reusable. It could have been dry'd out a bit more through the use of JavaScript templating and the routes could have been more RESTful but I did my best to TDD throughout this one as it has been a point of weakness in the past.

Create an IdeaBox where the actions communicate with a Rails API via AJAX calls and load the page without refresshing.

Loved: I loved the simplicity of the interface, and the sorting feature.
Advice: Just look over things at the very end and refactor JS.

ScaleUp

GitHubURL https://github.com/patrickmedaugh/HubStub

Original Assignment https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown

Scale up an existing Pivot project to be performant at a much higher scale of database information and requests per minute.

Deployed to Heroku: N

Uses Newrelic: Y

What is the average performance and traffic? 1

Required number of records seeded? Y

Load Testing Script 3

Performance Optimization Techniques 2


Understood caching concepts but didn't unravel the existing code to create more efficient queries. Need to delve into what the code is doing on a conceptual level and use that to guide enhancing the performance.

GameTime (Lightcycles)

Original Assignment https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown

Create a game using JavaScript in the browser. We used canvas for our project and implemented multiple difficulty levels.

Notes

Gameplay is playable as an early prototype
Had trouble requiring files and having functions show
Weren't able to test, get jQuery going
Used kind of a temporary file testing because of require problems
Some git confusion about a few tests
Look for opportunities to name/extract magic data. Consider a config object
Talk about process to figure out why we didn't get help with fundamental issues
Not able to run JSHint
