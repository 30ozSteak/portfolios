# Eric Dowty - Module 4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My biggest emphasis coming into module 4 in order of precedence were ensuring I had accepted a job offer, improving test driven JavaScript development, building a project with socket.io, and learning a JavaScript front end framework. 

### End of Module Assessment

Wowowowowowowowowow. The 24 hour crucible... what's to be said that hasn't been said?! I received staight 3's, no time for polish on this bad johnny. I think the takeaway for me was that code wasn't meant to be written this way. It's a good feeling to feel disgusted with your code base even with a working product. I'm glad I feel this way, it means that Turing has done their job well. Well written, tested, and maintainable code is what I aspire to build in the future.

### Attendance

I missed one day at Turing on the 17th of July to go to a day long job interview at Invoca in Boulder, CO.

### Projects

#### Idea Box 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eric-dowty/ideabox-JavaScript)

I did not get assessed on Idea Box 2.0 because it was never ready for production and I was not happy with the product. I actually did 2 iterations of this project. I stopped developing the first iteration when I realized that I had lots and lots of JavaScript code that was untested. I stopped developing the second iteration (review GitHub URL below) after spending almost 2 weeks trying to develop a framework of my own for asynchronous JavaScript code using a mix of MagicCarpet and Mocha-Chai repositories. Handling state while testing multiple AJAX calls proved difficult, although I am confident with more time I will be able to build a system that works well.

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eric-dowty/HubStub)

I did not get assessed on the Scale Up. I did complete building the seed file and the load script on my own, however, by the time I was ready to start optimization I was gearing up for my job interview with Invoca. I made a judgement call to spend the days I would have been optimizing the Scale Up prepping for my interview. The interview coincidentally was on the same day as the Scale Up assessment. GitHub URL is below for review. 

## Team

### Projects

  I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time (2048)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eric-dowty/JavaScript-2048)

This week-and-a-half long project was a pure JavaScript implementation of a simple game. In our case that game was 2048. It was evaluated by Steve with the following results:

  * Functional Expectations: 3
  * Test-Driven Development: 4
  * Breaking Logic Into Components: 4
  * Fundamental JS and Style: 3
  * Code Sanitation: 1

##### My Contribution

Tess and I paired on almost 100% of writing the code base. She implemented Pokemon mode and I implemented Turing mode with those sweet sweet GIFs.

##### Takeaway

It was nice to test drive JavaScript code. My JavaScript is getting better, but still lacking as see on the final eval project.

#### Turing Scavenger Hunt

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eric-dowty/scavenger-hunt)

A scavenger hunt app for the Turing scavenger hunt.

  * Completion: 4
  * Organization: 3.5
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Code Quality: 2
  * User Experience: 3
  * Performance: 4

##### My Contribution

I worked mostly on the Team client portion of the application. We were able to break apart the Rails portions of development, however, did a lot of group pairing on the Node and web-socket implementations.

##### Takeaway

It was great to work with Andrew and Kristina. We implemented a lot of challenging technical features which required us all to be working at a fast pace during the project execution. Features include: websockets, node, express and a rails backend to implement a pub/sub model which keeps track of team submissions.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave honest feedback to Andrew, Kristina, and Tess and will be giving feedback to the rest of my cohort by the end of the module.

### Playing a Part

 * Wrote a post "Get Some PI: A Beginner's Guide to Integrating Hardware" for the Turing blog
 * Was accepted to host a session at Rocky Mountain Ruby (RRB) with Tom (RRB is in September)
 * Introduced several of my cohort members to possible employers 
 * Attended two Denver.rb meetups including Mihir's during our 24 hour final assessment
 * Attended the Turing field day... won some sweet cornhole games
 * Gave my Develop Denver ticket away to Patrick to help him do some networking
 * Was a featured student in the weekly Posse Post
