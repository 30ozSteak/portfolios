# Tom Leskin - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on JavaScript and pretty much anything that was heavy in algorithms in general. I used Exercism a couple times a week at the beginning of the module, read a few chapters of "Eloquent JavaScript" book, and tried to apply these concepts in my individual and team projects. In the end, I feel much more comfortable with JavaScript and am even starting to get familiar with some frameworks. I felt at a disadvantage going into the job hunt compared to others in my cohort when it comes to the algorithms so I've been trying to spend more time working on my Ruby fundamentals and problem solving. I spent time working through some algorithms and data structures to accomplish this, reaching out to Mihir for some help and got a book from a developer at Twitter in Boulder to help with this as well. I planned to try to finish strong at Turing and I think I've accomplished that since nearly every score I've gotten whether in an individual or group projects or assessment have been favorable.

### End of Module Assessment

### Notes

For the end of module assessment, we had 24 hours to build a task manager app that could contain many lists, the lists could have many tasks and it had numerous ways to filter and search the data. The app was built with Rails and JavaScript. Going into the assessment, I felt like it was slow at the beginning then ramped up quickly. While I started with TDD, as time went on and the pressure was setting in, the tests went on the back-burner as I attempted to finish the app. I knew that I could do everything that the app required, so I really tried to give it my all and stayed at Turing all day and night, not going home until about 3 p.m. Wednesday.

Notes from Jeff:

Missing list description
Submitting a task without title (or maybe dates) crashes
Missing sort by due date but NBD
Megasearch filtering is interesting, works, hard to use
Extra email feature delivers email
Very few tests but like that they're done at different levels
Ruby and Rails parts are solid
JS looks good, like that it's not all just libraries

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of coming in late on Tuesday, July 21 since I was having a cultural fit interview with Bing Chou from Simpler.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### IdeaBox 2.0

https://github.com/tleskin/idea_box_2.0

### Notes

This was our first project of the module and our first major project in JavaScript. The idea was to build IdeaBox again that be made in Module 2 in Rails, but this time with all JavaScript and jQuery/AJAX.

### Scores

Reviewed by: Mihir Parikh
Features: 3.5
UI: 3.5
Testing: 3.5
Rails Style: 3.5
Ruby Style: 3.5
JavaScript Style: 3.5
Loved: I love how you integrated your edit and delete button/links into your JS.
Advice: Call your mom! A little more test coverage.

#### Scale Up

https://github.com/tleskin/scale_up

### Notes

With the Scale Up, we were given an old Pivot project and were told to scale up the project by adding nearly a million records into the database, creating a script to constantly hit the app and implement techniques to allow the app to work at this scale. I felt it was extremely valuable project, one that I don't think any Turing student should leave the program without doing.

### Scores

I was evaluated by Horace, who was impressed with how fast the app responded:

Deployed to Heroku: Y
Uses Newrelic: Y
What is the average performance and traffic? 4
Required number of records seeded? Y
Load Testing Script 4
Performance Optimization Techniques 3
Additional Features 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time

https://github.com/MichelleGolle/duck-hunt

## Collaborator: Michelle Golle

### Notes

For our project we wanted to build a game that would be managable and realistic in the period we had to create it. Michelle and I built a simplified version of the NES classic Duck Hunt and I think it was an extremely valuable project. We got to build a fun game, work on our JavaScript skills and ended up with a project that I'm proud of.

Notes from Jeff:

Game is decently playable. Some unpredictability of the speed unless you refresh.
You can shoot ducks
Used Canvas for moving the duck around
15 tests that all pass
Decided to improve code rather than build more features
JS implementation looks pretty clean
Look for opportunities to push functionality out of your "god object" into the children -- out from index.js into other files.

### Scores

We were evaluated by Jeff.

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 3
Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
Fundamental JS and Style: 3
Code Sanitation: 4

#### IPAPI (Ember/Rails)

https://github.com/tleskin/IPAPI-rails
https://github.com/boomkenster/IPAPA-ember

## Collaborators: Tess Griffin, Kenny (Fumei) Chen

### Notes

For our two week final project, our group wanted to build a Rails-backed API and then learn Ember, which would consume it on the front-end. In the end, we were not able to complete all of the requirements we set for ourselves, but we learned a lot and made a strong effort. I still would have liked to have completed the project, but I think it was an admiral first effort, especially since we had no lessons on Ember and had to pretty much seek the information and learn it on our own in the last two weeks. In order to learn Ember, there were a couple nights where I spent hours working on it. The one night I spent about four hours watching Steve's IdeaBox Ember video where I took notes and followed along building it.

### Scores

We were evaluated by Steve:

Completion: 2
Organization: 3
Test-Driven Development: 3
Code Quality: 3
User Experience: 2
Performance: 4

### Feedback to Me

Tom! You are great. Your portfolio is looking solid. You're a quiet, reserved little unicorn and your magical presence has made Turing a better place. -- Kristina

Mr. Calm, Cool and Collected. I appreciate how you are always willing to lend a helping hand. It's always great to pair with you. You do a good job explaining..... this; and other JavaScript related topics. -- Lori

I always enjoy working with you and after pairing on Game Time I think you've definitely met your goal of improving your javascript skills. It's also really cool that you've made time to mentor outside of school. -- Michelle

Tom, I love how Turing has brought you out of your shell and how you've opened up since module 1. You're a great team member to work with and you really keep up to date in the tech world. #freestuffandpajamajeans4lyf -- Patrick

TOMMY! Tom has excelled every module. In module one I remember Tom being oblivious at times but now he can do any task and believes in himself. He has incredible work ethic, amazingly diligent in his process and research and resilient in his efforts. -- Kenny

### Response to Feedback

I started out Turing feeling that since I had some coding experience beforehand that it wasn't going to be that bad and I would be one of the strongest people. It seems that Turing kinda broke me down in Module 1, but it helped me realize where I needed to improve. I was quiet in the beginning, but gained more of a voice as I gained more confidence. I've always been a quiet person, for the most part only until people get to know me or I them, and I agree that it took a while, but I did finally come out of my shell. I've wanted to help people new to coding and I've done that by volunteering as my confidence has grown. I would also agree that I did improve my JavaScript skills 100% and don't write the same quality code in JavaScript that I did a month and a half ago. I've really enjoyed that in later module as I've improved me skills I've been able to help my peers and can remember helping just about everyone at least once.
