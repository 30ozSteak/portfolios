# Tess Griffin - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I was looking to improve my TDD chops because I felt that in M3 those were lacking. I also wanted to gain more confidence in all areas of JavaScript including JavaScript testing.

### End of Module Assessment

For the end of module assessment we made a 24-hour advanced task manager. I was evaluated by Horace. Some of the notes were that the JavaScript could have been better organized but the concepts were good. The rails knowledge was proficient, but there could a better attempt to use RESTful routing for custom routes.

* Features: 3
* UI: 4
* Testing: 3
* Rails Style: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* JavaScript Style: 3

### Attendance

I attended all days and classes except for Friday July 10th while visiting San Diego for Comic Con and July 15th, 16th, and 17th for a job interview in Ottawa.

### Work

The following is the individual work this module.

#### IdeaBox 2.0

This was a 4 day long project that was revenge of the idea box. The concept to was to have CRUD functionality for ideas without refreshing the page using AJAX. Mine was evaluated by Michelle.

Loved: Good UI, features working well- liked the implementation
Advice: Add js tests and maybe move thumbs up and down method to model

* Features: 3

This was a 7 day project where you had a take a previous student's pivot, add a million records and to fix up the performance. I was in Ottawa for the Shopify interviews during the assessment. I gave myself scores based on what I have. I did not do the load script because I felt that with the time I had to work on the project with the interview, that time would be better spent on fixing performance issues.

* Deployed to Heroku: Y
* Uses Newrelic: Y
* What is the average performance and traffic? 3
* Required number of records seeded? Y
* Load Testing Script N/A
* Performance Optimization Techniques 3
* Additional Features 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following group projects

#### Game Time 2048

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/eric-dowty/JavaScript-2048)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This was a 7 day project with myself and Eric to build the puzzle game 2048. We were very dedicated to test driving the back end JavaScript of this project.

Notes

* Good use of test-driven development
* Multiple modes of game play
* No use of prototype methods

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 4
* Fundamental JS and Style: 3
* Code Sanitation: 1

#### Final Project: IPAPI

* [GitHub Ember URL](https://github.com/boomkenster/IPAPA-ember)
* [GitHub Rails URL](https://github.com/tleskin/IPAPI-rails)

This was a 2 week final project where our groups objective was to learn Ember. The idea was to build a back end Rails api that fed an Ember front end. In the end, we were not able to complete all of the requirements we set for ourselves, but we learned a lot and made a strong effort. We were evaluated by Steve:

* Completion: 2 
* Organization: 3 
* Test-Driven Development: 3 
* Code Quality: 3 
* User Experience: 2
* Performance: 4 

### Feedback to Me

I feel that the feedback for me has been positive all of the way through Turing. I have gotten some feedback that sometimes I let things get to me too much, and I've really been trying hard to improve that about myself.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I've given feedback to everyone that's asked for it. I have given it also to a few people who didn't.

### Playing a Part

Besides giving my lightning talk on July 7th on 3D animation, I feel like I've been involved a lot in the community of Turing. I've gone to meetups around Denver including Denver.rb, and I did go to Denver.rb on July 11th during our final assessment to support Mihir who was speaking that night. I've organized lunches and helped other students on their personal projects. It's been really wonderful being apart of this community.
