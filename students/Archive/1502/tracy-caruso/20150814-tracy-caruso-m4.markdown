# Tracy Caruso - Module 4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
My goal this module was to get more hands on use with apis. I also wanted more
experience writing tests for JS and learning JS. Another large part of my fourth
module has been searching for jobs, and preparing for interviews.

### End of Module Assessment

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/tracymcaruso/tasktime)


Overall I was pretty disappointed with the outcome of my final project.
I worked diligently however hit some roadblocks that delayed my progress. I'm
looking forward to do the reassessment as I think it would give me the opportunity
to makeup for the areas I was not able to complete.

  * Features 2
  * User Interface 2
  * Testing 2
  * Rails Style 3
  * Ruby Style 3
  * JS Style 2

### Attendance
 * I missed, July 17th due to illness.
 * July 31st for an all day job interview.
 * The morning of August 3rd for a Job interview.
 * The morning of August 6th for a job interview.


### Projects

I completed the following individual project for this module:

#### Idea Box 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tracymcaruso/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

  In this four-day project I implemented  Idea Box in
  JavaScript. I was peer evaluated by Dave and Kenny.

  * Features: 3
  * UI: 5 (should review your front end classes)
  * Testing: 2 (for effort)
  * Rails style: 3
  * Ruby style: 3
  * JS Style: 2.5
  * Loved: You did it
  * Advice: Do more

  #### Scale Up (HubStub)

    * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tracymcaruso/scaleup)
    * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

    The biggest part of this project was the setup, which led me to not gain as much experience in learning how to optimize a site. However I did feel like a gained a lot just reading through the code and finding out how it was implemented. It was also a good lesson in getting to work with messy code, and trying to figure out how to refactor it.


    * Average Response: 2, seeing about 1000ms on average
    * Load Testing: 2, hits some features and does things
    * Database Load: Y, good data
    * Performance: 1, nothing for this
    * Additional Feature: 3


## Team

### Projects

  I participated in the following team projects:

  #### Get Me Outta Here

  * https://github.com/loriculberson/Fly-Me-Now
  * https://get-me-outta-here.herokuapp.com/

  Wanna get out of town....fast? With Get Me Outta Here, you can find an airline ticket under $600 to one of ten U.S. tourist destinations. We consumed an airport conversion API, and a flight API, implemented an Angular.js front end and a Rails backend.

  ## My Contribution
  I set up the AITA api, and the Vayant api, designed the site, and worked out the logic involved in tying the two together. I
  also focus on learning and implementing Angular.

  ## Evaluation Comments
  * Completed stated goal to pull real-time flight options in a timely manner
  Pretty good testing on rails level, including connections to external APIs

  Good:
  * use of ruby service objects to abstract job of interacting with external APIs
  * Pretty effective at applying angular organization patterns for Services in UI layer
  * ruby layer testing seems ok

  Bad:
  * General sloppyness around code "tidyness" -* comments hanging around, unused files and templates, trailing whitespace, exposed API keys, etc etc
  * Angular side feels a little brittle in terms of ability to move things around; points to somewhat weak understanding of what each piece is doing in that portion of the application

  * UX is solid; flow is very simple so we only have a couple pages. Would be helpful to have more things clearly labeled in the UI especially when viewing flight results.

  * Also all the type is enormous.

  ## Scores
  * Completion: 3
  * Organization: 3
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Code Quality: 3
  * User Experience: 3
  * Performance: 3

#### Game Time (Tetris)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/haveanicedavid/tetris)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

  This project was a lot of fun and Dave was a great partner. He was definitely more experienced with JavaScript than I was and
  did his best to work through the logic with me, while helping me learn how to build the JS to go with it.

  * Functional Expectations: 4
  * Test-Driven Development: 3
  * Breaking Logic Into Components: 3.5
  * Fundamental JS and Style: 4
  * Code Sanitation: 3.5


##### My Contribution

  Dave and I worked through the logical parts together and made a game plan for how to implement the code. We worked together on the JavaScript with David being the team lead. I worked separately on testing and building out the front end.

##### Takeaway

  * Testing JS does make it easier to implement
  * JavaScript seems a lot more cumbersome than Ruby and many subtleties that will take some getting used to


## Community


### Playing a Part

  * I spend a lot of time pairing with students from all modules on front and and help them through their problems.
  * I do my best to encourage my peers and keep a positive attitude.
  * I go out of my way to meet people from other modules and try to make them feel welcome.


### Peer Feedback

##### Jack Yeh
Tracy is always willing to help and share her knowledge. More importantly, she does so with a positive attitude, even when everyone around her is stressed out. She is especially good at taking the time to explain front-end.

##### Minnie Lee
I always enjoyed working with you, because we can have fun and work hard at the same time! :) Also, you work really hard to not only get things done but to also understand all of the pieces involved in the process.

##### Dave Daniel
I really enjoyed working with you on Gametime (and other projects). You're more than just a good designer (though one of the great things about working with you is knowing the end product is going to look fantastic), and your positivity makes you a pleasure to be around.

##### Lori Culberson
Feedback for project: Solid implementation of the front end design. Incredibly creative. Nice job using Angular for the first time!

##### Morgan Miller
Tracy is the sunshine that lights the fake windows in the dungeon. She always makes herself available to help people when they canâ€™t figure out the fuckery of CSS, and her laugh is totally infectious.
