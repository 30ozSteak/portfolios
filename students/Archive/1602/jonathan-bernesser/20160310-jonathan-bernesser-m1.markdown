### Individual Projects

*Below is a breakdown of all individual projects I completed this module*

#### Mastermind

* [Github URL/mastermind](https://github.com/Jbern16/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

In this week one echo project, I was able to implement a Mastermind game with limited ruby experience.
The game logic was fully functional. I was evaluated by Mike Dao.

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 2
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2


#### Binary Search Tree

* [Github URL/bst](https://github.com/Jbern16/bst)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

In this project I successfully implemented a Binary Search Tree using recursion. For it being my first foray into recursion I had a lot of fun figuring it out in this implementation.

Evaled by Nate.

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation/ Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3.5 "Application uses both looping and recursion when it makes sense"

#### Sorting Suite

* [Github URL/ss](https://github.com/Jbern16/ss)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Successfully implemented a bubble sort, insert sort and merge sort alogorithm.

Evaled by Horace
'Testing is good -- good variety of cases and coverage'

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Testing: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* Organization: 4

#### Complete Me

* [Github URL/cm](https://github.com/Jbern16/cm)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

Successfully implemented a word autocomplete CLI using a trie data structure plus two extensions in 3 days. Nodes in this implementation do not hold data. I believe this was a more difficult implementation and I welcomed the challenge. Evaled by Horace

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3


## Team

### Projects

*I participated in the following team projects:*

### Hyde

* [Github URL/Hyde](https://github.com/GKhalsa/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Implemented a jekkyl-like blog engine. Testing for this was extremely tough as it involved creating directories and files. We completed two extensions but missed css converting functionality on assessment. Overall, I feel my File I/O had been extremely upgraded from this project. I received 3s for Logic and Style but could not be told what I could have done better for a 4. I believe we deserved a 4. Evaled by Nate

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TDD: 3
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerables and Collections: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4

### Black Thursday

* [GithubUrl/Black Thursday](https://github.com/Jbern16/black_thursday)

Implemented a sales engine to parse and query data from csv files. Tom and I were able to successfuly DTR and work toward a successful implementation. We strove toward TDD every step of the way. This was a cool project to put together everything we've learned this module and apply it. Building such a large code base was a new and necessary experience. Overall, I am very happy with how it came together. I think we did a great job at breaking things logical down and passing all methods that could, down the stack. Are spec harness performed very fast and our own local test suit ran in 3 seconds. From the eval, I know now to identify compacts as warning sign for probably using the wrong enum. Evaled by Nate

* Functional Expectations: 3
* TDD: 4
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3.5
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4

Comments:
* Good encapsulation of repository setup, but could be one step better
* Nice use of Open struct in tests. Fast tests!
* Compact is a red flag. Probably want to use find_all/select
* Blocks. Nice. Could have been clearer, but I like your moxie.
* Good use of module with CSVLoader
* Dropping vowels in the name of code sanitation is zealous


### Feedback to Me from Instructor

Feedback **Jeff Ruane/Pairing** :

* "I really enjoyed the couple of times that we got to work together this module. You came in with Mastermind in the first week, and I was really impressed by how good your code was given that it was the first week. Then, a week later, you came in with binary search tree, and you had some pretty cool recursion going on, and that was really cool to see too. From everything I've seen from you, you have really good instincts, you're easy to work with, and you're eager to learn, which are all some really great qualities to have to succeed at Turing. I'll be excited to see what you're doing in the later modules, I bet you come up with some really cool stuff.""

Feedback **Horace/Pairing**

* Worked on tower of hanoi problem; didn't finish it due to time but had a good session working through increasingly difficult versions of the problem
* Appreciate your curiosity and eagerness to dive into problems like this
* Keep that up as you go into later modules -- this kind of problem tends to come up a lot in job interviews, and sometimes falls by the wayside as people get deeper into web-focused work
* Interesting points we looked at:
* Modeling data for a problem -- often basic data structures (arrays, hashes, strings) will work before we dive into more complicated mechanisms like classes
* Taking problem step by step -- don't forget TDD ideas of solving tiny iterations first
* Using tests to define an interface -- don't dance around the problem here. define what it means to solve it in terms of what inputs go in and what outputs come out -- then express that in code.

### Feedback to Me From Students

* Feedback from **Gurusundesh Khalsa/Hyde Partner**:
"Johnny B was a joy to partner with. He has a surprisingly great understanding of ruby from the relatively short time that he has been at it. I really enjoyed this collaboration, he was fearless in his different approaches, and that is such an incredible quality when it comes to programming. He responded really well to any input or change, and was really curious about different techniques. He can sometimes stay rooted in a singular approach, but you know what, sometimes you have to do that to really understand a problem!"

* Feedback from **Jonathan Liss/self-solicited**:
"Jon surprised me with how quickly he adapted to Turing.  He joined me and 9 others in the Echo group on day 1, and quickly stood out in my mind as someone who had a great knack for retaining knowledge at a fast pace.  Even though he didn't have the Ruby know-how during the first few days, he was able follow along and absorb a tremendous amount of details.  Because of his ability to understand problems and how to solve them, he was able to very quickly adapt the mindset of a programmer, and the Ruby skill followed just as fast.  He went from being a novice in the first week to one of the strongest and most capable in the class.  I enjoyed pairing with him whenever I could because of his ability to rapidly take in new approaches and skills.  Aside from his technical abilities, Jon has a very welcoming and light-hearted demeanor, making him very approachable for pairing and questions.  Because of this, I have no doubt that Jon will be a tremendously successful programmer, and I look forward to seeing what he can achieve as he progresses through Turing.


* Feedback from **Claudia Kiesenhofer/Pairing**:
"Hi John, I really enjoyed working with you on the coding problem today. It was great to discuss the problem because you gave me time to grasp what it is about even though you were a lot faster to understand where we were at. Thank you for explaining the refactoring idea for the character class with constants. It helped my understanding how to use them. We got to a really great place with our ideas how to simplify the classes. I agree, we could have stayed a bit more focussed after that to execute our ideas. I didn't really know how to write the code for it but I didn't communicate that. It would have been great to do it together. Thank you for your feedback on work flow. I already got that feedback before and it confirms what I need to focus on. Great pairing!"


## Community

### Giving Feedback
* Feedback to **Gurusundesh Khalsa/partner for Hyde**:
"Feedback: from: Jonathan Bernesser, to: Gurusundesh Khalsa, text: Sunny was a great partner to work with. He explained his thought process when attacking a problem and was courteous and patient when I had any ideas or questions. Further he was respectful of things discussed in DTR. We were able to complete the project with time to spare to focus on completing two extensions. I believe we were an efficient team.""

* Feedback to **Claudia Kiesenhofer/pairing**:
"Feedback: from: Jonathan Bernesser, to: Claudia Kiesenhofer, text: I think you did a great job diagnosing the problem and testing first. I was impressed by your willingness to understand the entirety of the problem before attacking the refactoring. I think we could have done a better job staying focused but I think that was my fault. One thing I would say you can work on is workflow. Great pairing! Thanks!""

* Feedback to **Emily McClung/pairing**:
"Feedback: from: Jonathan Bernesser, to: Emily McClung, text: By explaining the problem and walking through how I thought the test should past allowed me to understand the problem more which was beneficial. She was able to offer critique of my thinking that benefited the team coming to a resolution. I don't think she could have done much better. I believe one thing that stands between where Emily is now and where she could be is her willingness to wait for the answer rather than taking feedback and trying to come with her own implementation."

* Feedback to **Jonathan Liss/solicited**
"Working with Jon throughout this module was a huge benefit for me. He was able to logically break down conceptually dense topics and present them to me in a way I can understand. Because of his eagerness and ability to do this, I believe I was able to grow faster as a programmer. Where my weakness was breaking down the problem, he proved exemplary at this. His willingness to answer questions, especially during the echo track was a hugely important for me to get where I am today."
