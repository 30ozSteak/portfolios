# Jenny Soden - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to focus on learning ruby syntax, developing problem solving skills, and be better about time management. I wanted to be comfortable and confident with my skill set, so I am able to feel as though I can conquer any challenge laid before me.
Throughout the module, I learned about other programming tools, such as TDD, which I wanted to also focus on being comfortable with.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Horace

Challenge: Baseline

Notes:

* Some things going smoothly and quite fluid
* But still really struggling with some of the very fundamental concepts
* Going to need to do a lot of practice with basic data structures and usage
* Already were planning to repeat so mostly using this as a diagnostic
* Workflow and tooling are all very good
* Basic object setup and definition was pretty good but still getting some confusion around object lifecycle and local vs. instance variables

Students will be evaluated according to the following rubric:

### Notes

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 1: Developer struggles to complete the baseline assignment.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### Work

During the module

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MsJennyGiraffe/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

During this project I learned a lot. I got class responsibilities wrong, and I didn't test enough. Having this project early taught me what I needed to focus on throughout the module. I didn't have a great idea of what I was doing, but this was the first time I felt like I was being asked to do something so drastically outside of my comfort level, and I think it taught me the harshest lesson of Turing -- get used to being uncomfortable.

Assessed By: Andrew

Notes: Missing multiple things from base functionality, but was very close. After conversation I think understanding is there. 2.5 on encapsulation because node has too much list responsibility ( append count etc.). 3 for syntax and style. Everything looked good, short methods, some refactoring still needed, but overall great style. Looping and recursion in the project and used effectively. I wonder what this score would have been if the project was completed, but I think programmers understanding of these things is there.


### 1. Functional Expectations - 1

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development - 2

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components - 2.5

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion - 3

* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
* 2: Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately
* 1: Application struggles to loop/recurse at all

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MsJennyGiraffe/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

While working on Engima I really tried to focus on test driven development. I attempted to focus on a bigger picture, and I didn't pay enough attention to how it was actually supposed to run. I got good practice with making a bigger project, and continued working on my Ruby fundamentals but I think mostly I learned to really pay attention to details in specs.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* 32 tests, all pass.
* Application doesn't follow specification, but does encrypt and decrypt.
* Think about how methods and things really just send messages to each other
rather than modifying instance variables.
* File IO not implemented

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application is missing one of the three operations

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

## Team

### Projects

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/patrickwhardy/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

As far as the first partner project goes, I think I got lucky. Patrick was very willing to help me though this. I struggled to understand ERB, and I still think I don't quite understand how it works. I got better at communication skills, as well as looking at a bigger picture while paying attention to the spec. This project allowed me to get more comfortable with collections and enumerables, and it taught me the basics of ARGV, making files, and working with a lot of moving parts.

Assessed by: Lovisa

Repo: https://github.com/patrickwhardy/hyde

notes:

- would have liked to see more integration tests and sad path tests
- when testing, avoid hardcoded values and organize tests in a way to make them more readable
- too many instance variables!! Pass lvars around

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations as tested by the spec harness

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
* 3: Five or fewer complaints
* 2: Six to ten complaints
* 1: More than ten complaints

### Giving Feedback

To Patrick Hardy
Working with Patrick was a pleasure. His attitude is very easy going, and je jumps right into problems in order to figure them out. He's extremely dedicated, and is knowledgable of the Ruby language. While working on Hyde, he was always able to write code, and explain it to me in a way that made sense. If I had any advice for Patrick it would be to try to look at the bigger picture more. It's something I know we both struggled with. Overall, I really enjoyed working with Patrick. He's an excellent team member!

To Emily Blanchard
Working with Emily was a pleasure. She's a kind-hearted individual, and is very relaxing to be around. She is expressive with her thoughts, easy to communicate with and collaborates ideas well. As a team, we need to be more careful about reading prompts, as we are both too eager to get coding. That's passion, boys. If I had one piece of advice for Emily, it would be to get a good night's sleep, and to stop putting herself down, even if it's jokingly.

To Joshua Washke
Josh is very good at explaining and re-explaining concepts such as relationships, and basic ruby syntax, and listening to suggestions on code. He is quite confident in his abilities and in able to assert himself without being overwhelming. Keep on keeping on.

### Being a Community Member

From Patrick
 Jennifer was great to work with throughout the Hyde project. I really appreciate her initiative in taking on projects like writing tests or completing an iteration independently. She also was very resourceful and thorough in sketching out big-picture design design and organization of the project. An area that she could improve is implementing these ideas in code and troubleshooting issues with that implementation.  When running into things that are conceptually difficult such as ERB, it may be helpful to spend more time in pry or the program troubleshooting various solutions to get a better understanding of how it works. It was great that Jennifer reached out to many students and instructors when we had difficulty understanding, which she told me had been difficult for her to do in the past. Overall, I think we both learned a lot from this project and Jennifer was a very pleasant and communicative team member!

From Joshua Washke
I paired with Jennifer Soden on refactoring Engima and have paired with her many times before. Her positivity and communication skills are an asset to any group situation. She is capable of explaining her thought process very well and is an able programmer. The best advice I can give her is to work on reading code slowly and to try to stop her brain from filling in gaps, but rather focus on what each line and block is evaluating to and returning.

From Ilana Corson

We were able to talk through problems well together and come to a solution. As a team, we could be more familiar with what we are actually doing. Since Jennifer didn't type, she could type next time but I don't know her skill level so wouldn't say she needs to do that better. Both of us just need to practice!!!!

### Playing a Part

* offered emotional support for fellow students

* made myself available for pairing for members of 1602

## Review

# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual
skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.


## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.


## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.


* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

OUTCOME: RETAINED
