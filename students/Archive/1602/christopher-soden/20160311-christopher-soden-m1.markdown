# Christopher Soden - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goals evolved over the course of the module. I am eager to pursue such an
interesting and challenging field. My primary goal was and is to greatly
improve my programming skills and become a valuable job candidate. As I progressed
through the module, I began to refine these goals. To accomplish the high
level goal I needed to improve my knowledge of tools. This included becoming more
familiar with the Atom Text Editor's functions, keyboard shortcuts and available
packages. This also meant gaining more familiarity with the Ruby language- the
different built in functions and their use and syntax. Learning about using pry
for debugging.

### End of Module Assessment

Challenge: Option 3

Notes:

- Typing speed could improve. Also looking at the keyboard a lot.
- Good knowlege of keyboard shortcuts, and using them appropriately.  

Scores:

* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Completion and Progress: 3
* Testing: 4
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3



### Work

I completed the following individual projects during the module:

#### Jungle Beats
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/linked_list_project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

I created a node class and a singly linked-list using Ruby. Doing this project
really caused me to consider the benefits of a DOUBLY linked-list vs. singly
linked.

Assessed By: Tess

Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping *or* Recursion: 3


#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/Night_Writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

I created a master class that executed the application, and helper classes with
special functionality split out. This project really challenged me to grow in
handling string processing and File IO. I came to better understand the .gsub
method and the implications of passing objects rather than values. I had to do
some research to find the correct syntax for using regex's; but the biggest
challenge was looking at the special cases around contractions and splitting the
output into 80 character lines. I learned more about the match method - eventually
finding a way to use that to accomplish the split.

Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4


## Team

### Projects

I worked on two team projects during the first module.

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ColinOsborn/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Colin Osborn and I built a basic blog creation engine that takes parameters
and creates a blog file structure.
The biggest challenge of this project was learning how to work with the file
structure. I found the Dir class through my reading, but Jared pointed me to a
module called FileUtils that had some even more effective methods.

### Feedback To Me
From Colin Osborn:
Working with Chris was great, his schedule was very accommodating for collaboration and he also made himself available at all times to answer questions. I feel like his strengths were my weaknesses and he was great at driving home TDD. If we were to work together once again I would be in agreement that more defined organization would help most issues and would fix possible time pitfalls. I'd say for things Chris could work on would be the same issues that I have, which would be tackling problems in smaller pieces. I think the only thing that stand's between Chris now and where they could be is just more practice, he seem's to be working from a solid foundation and logic is usually on the right path. All in all, it was a great experience working with Chris and learning all that I could from him.

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Matt Pindell and I built a program to read in data from various CSV files,
establish relationships between data elements and answer certain questions from
the data.
This project definitely developed our skills with hashes. The complexity of
the data hashes we had to create and the hash-parameters passed
into and returned from the methods made this a very challenging problem.

Assessed By: Nate

Notes:  
- Data manager got out of control. Might need some modules, or maybe push responsibility to other classes, existing or not
- Use mock data. Gonna take some setup time, but better
- Class variables are not preferable, is there another way to do this? Experiment with 'nil protector'
- Good test coverage
- Using lots of different ruby tools at your disposal. Good work.

## Community

### Being a Community Member

#### Giving Feedback

I gave constructive feedback to Kris Foss and Claudia Kiesenhofer regarding
in-class projects we worked on together. I gave feedback to Sal Espinosa and
Thomas Pickett on an in-class assignment the three of us performed. And I gave feedback to Colin Osborn 
on the Hyde project we were paired for.

##### To Kris Foss
I think the list of test "to do's" was excellent. Something the team could do better: I'm not used to programming with others; trying to distribute the workload. Maybe instead of one person looking over the other's shoulder and sharing the process we could each write tests for different parts of the problem and then review/critique the tests to fill in any that seem lacking. Then split up responsibility for writing the methods to meet the tests. An obvious problem is that if one method is going to call another it has to know what parameters to pass and what results to expect. I know as I write my code I sometimes change these conditions as needs warrant. If we're going to be splitting up the problem we need to spec out methods, parameters and results before we get into writing. And then communicate if these specs need to change. I hate to lose the time at the start, but it'll certainly save time in the long run.

##### To Claudia Kiesenhofer
We had a good DTR. We shared screen/keyboard time respectfully. We both listened to and valued the other. Something the team could do better? We had a very limited time to work on the project; we didn't really get far enough to expose much in the way of team weaknesses. Maybe continue to improve in breaking down the problem into logical components?

##### To Sal Espinosa
Sal did an excellent job communicating with the team and sharing ideas. Something the team could do better next time, we should have run the unit tests first to establish a solid baseline.

##### To Thomas Pickett
Thomas had done the enigma project so he had a clear understanding of the program logic. I think the whole team worked well together sharing and discussing ideas to improve and refactor the project code. Something the team could do better: we should have run the unit tests before we started to ensure we had a solid baseline.

##### To Colin Osborn
Something that went very well: We had a great team dynamic where both people were able to be heard and contribute. We both looked for ways to help the other and make space for the other person to make contributions.  
Something the team could do better: We need more organization and structure. We need to be clear on what iterations we are going to have done by what day. We also need to schedule specific work times rather than organizing 'on the fly'.  
What stands between 'now' and 'could be': just practice. More familiarity with the tools.

#### Feedback to me

##### From Thomas Pickett  
Chris is extremely curious about how things work in ruby. We could shake up the dynamics of the group by alternating driver/navigator positions. Chris could work on his mechanical skills to navigate his computer better.  

##### From Sal Espinosa  
Chris did a great job taking control and driving the project. He was able to keep things moving and actually implement code while both Thom and I lobbed ideas at him. It's hard with shorter projects, but I think as a group we could've been better at sharing that responsibility and giving Chris some time to pitch ideas and some relief from the nitty gritty of making things work.  

##### From Kris Foss  
I didn't have a lot of time working with Chris but the time I have had, I've been really impressed.  Chris's background in computer science really shines through his logical programming.  He isn't arrogant, despite how advanced is knowledge is.  He's good at explaining concepts and always willing to step in and help.  He has a real eagerness and passion for programming and I can't wait to see what he creates.  He's also kind and approachable and he would make a great partner for any project.

### Playing a Part

Everytime I saw a classmate struggling with a problem I worked to help them. One example: the day before the lesson on binary I overheard Patrick Hardy say that he was very confused by it. I explained what I knew to him with a diagram. He later asked me for the diagram and used it to help his partner in the lesson. I used the same explanation with my partner for the lesson - Jeneve Parrish - and she said it made the subject very clear. 

I did reasearch on the Atom text editor and posted information on it in Slack. I
showed other classmates some shortcuts for programming and debugging with Ruby.

I went to the LGBT dinner and worked to make connections with people.

Not at this time.

## Pull Requests  
#### Enumerables Challenge branch into Master  
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cheljoh/enums_challenge/pull/1)  
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/applegrain/744468d56507d000e9d4)

The code is working. It's a silly way to do an `any?`. I think they want us to get experience rather than actually do something so clunky for real.

The trick is, once you create a proc, the code you've created is fixed. The only way to do something different is to create a different proc. So the `p_any?` method takes the value you want to search for and returns a canned procedure that only searches for that value. Then you call that procedure and pass it the array you want to check. You lose the flexibility of being able to change the search value on the fly.

It probably is possible to pass a block to a proc creator, basically giving you a block inside a block. That would recover some of the flexibility, but the current setup is consistent with the example code they gave us.

#### Headcount branch into Master
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/headcount/pull/5)  
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

The purpose of this branch is to begin work on iteration 3. It creates 2 custom error classes to meet the reqs of the problem.

It adds support for additional data files: 3rd and 8th grade data and proficiencies in Math, Reading and Writing. `StatewideTest` class and `StatewideTestRepository` have been created. Testers for these specific classes have been created, and method tests have been added to other testers to check the expanded functionality of other classes.

Currently (almost) passes the iteration 3 spec harness. One of the test calls in the iteration 3 harness is calling a method not included in the problem until iteration 5. Until we get to iteration 5 the program will not pass the number 3 spec harness.

The program completes the iteration 3 requirements. It needs partner review and approval, then it will be ready to integrate into master.

Created a `format_fixnum` method in the `CleanData` module to format integer strings read in from data files. Converts string to fixnum and returns "N/A" if the value is 0 or empty. Created `EconomicProfile` and `EconomicProfileRepository` classes. Created methods: `median_household_income_in_year`, `median_household_income_average`,  `children_in_poverty_in_year`, `free_or_reduced_price_lunch_percentage_in_year`,  `free_or_reduced_price_lunch_number_in_year`, and `title_i_in_year`. Also broke out some of the logic for these methods into helper methods.


## Blog Post  
* [Medium URL](https://medium.com/@karavol27/text-to-braille-a-beginner-classroom-problem-56997501d344#.ubyy5no9h)

Text to Braille: A Beginner Classroom Problem

The problem was to convert a text file into braille characters with support for contractions and a line break every 80 characters. In braille a contraction is a single character with a leading and trailing space that represents a common word, like the letter “c” for “can”.

The really hard part turned out to be the contractions. You have to slice the string into groups of 80 characters for outputting to 80 character braille lines. What happens if a contraction falls right before the slice and there's another one immediately after it? If you only have one contraction and it ends before the slice there's no problem. But if you have 2 in a row the last character of the first contraction is also the first character of the next contraction. You have to preserve them together.  And what happens if a contraction falls across the slice? You have to move the whole thing to the next line. 

You can find the contractions using regular expressions, but I didn't have much experience using regex's so I had to look up the syntax to construct the ones I needed. Then the problem becomes how do you pull them out of the string? There are several obvious search options built into the String class. But `scan` only returns the found strings, without any information about what index they were found at. Without the index you can't tell if the contractions were before, on or after the slice. And you can't tell if they come as a pair. 

I experimented using `match`, but it doesn't give all of the matches; it only returns the first match it finds. I was surprised to realize the `match` it returns is a special object that you can query for information - like beginning index and index of the next character after the match. That can be exactly what I need but I need it for every match, not just the first. 

Another surprise I got working on this project: I had been counting on methods like `scan` and `gsub` to search the entire string. After implementing I quickly realized the search for the next match only begins after the last. Obvious, right? 

The problem is a contraction pattern requires a beginning and ending space. Finding contraction text as part of a larger word does not qualify. But making the spaces part of the regex pattern means that it only looks at every other word. It can't handle a situation where the last character of one match is also the first character of the next match.  

I ended up traversing the string using multiple `match` calls. Ruby's `match` method does allow you to specify a starting index for the search. So I stored each result in an array and used the index of the end of the current result as the start of the next match search. This gave me an array of matches I could use. Once I had my match array I could iterate through the array and check the indices to see if any fell across the slice.

### Using the `p_any?` Method
----------------------------

    p_any?(X, symbol)

The `p_any?` method takes 2 parameters: a numeric value X and one of three
symbols, and returns a proc for comparing all values in an array to X.

The available symbols are:  
* :>  
* :<  
* :==  

They allow the user to select 'greater than', 'less than' and 'equals'

Example:

    any_less_than_3? = p_any?(3, :<)
    
    a = [4, 5, 6]  
    any_less_than_3?.call(a)  
    => false
    
    b = [1, 7, 8]  
    any_less_than_3?.call(b)  
    => true


The proc returned by `p_any?` is activated with the `.call` method. It will check
every element of an array against the pre-set value and return true if one, some or
all of the elements in the array match the set conditions (greater than, less
than or equal to the value X).


Remember that the conditions for comparison are set at the time the proc is
created. To do a different comparison you must create a different proc.
