## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

The thing that I struggled most with was being OK with struggling and trusting the
process. I am used to being able to figure things out pretty quickly and not 
having to struggle too much. That was definitely not the case, especially for the
first couple of projects. For both Date Night and Complete Me I felt like I was
banging my head against the wall for days at a time and not getting it. That led
to a lot of anxiety that I wasn't going to finish the project and a lot of self
doubt about my own abilities. However, it always seemed to mostly come together at
the end. I also noticed that most people around me were banging their heads too,
so maybe it wasn't me, but just the way the program was designed. When I figured
this out, it helped reduce my anxiety; however, struggle and uncertainty are still
not something I feel good about and something I know I will have to continue working on.
