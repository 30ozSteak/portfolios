## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I wanted to prove to myself that I was able to attend everyday and absorb as much
information as I could. I know that I was successful in achieving the first part.
I came in every day, including when I was not feeling so well, because I did not
want to fall into the same holes that I have fell into with college. I think that
I was successful when it comes to absorbing information as well. Looking at how
far I have come along in regards to being able to program in Ruby I am amazed at
how fast it has come.

#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled the most with testing in this module. With all of the past self-teaching
I've done I never really got into testing. I heard about TDD but never read into it much.
I learned that testing is actually a great way to drive development, especially
when I reach a point where I'm not sure where to go next.

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite project this module was Battleship, even though I did not do as well
as I would have liked. I thought it was a very interesting project to work on,
especially after working on the projects that had us building data structures.

My least favorite project was Date Night. I did not enjoy that project that much
because I have been exposed to Binary Search Trees in the past so I felt that
I was just reapplying knowledge that I already had, not building new knowledge.
However, the project did reinforce a lot of the things that I knew.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?

I learned that I need to work more efficiently. I did the majority of my
independent projects at home and feel that I did not use my time as well as I
could have.

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?

I learned that I can work with someone a lot better than I thought I could.
Pairing was valuable because it gave me the opportunity to bounce ideas
off of someone that has the same vested interest in the project. I found that
I was able to more efficiently make use of my time when someone else was relying
on me.

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
